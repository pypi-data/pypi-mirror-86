# NOTE(zdenek-dvorak):
# Restart of nova services is needed for correct RPC version selection.
# Nova service containers can run on one or multiple hosts.
# This depends on installation. Goal is to restart services on all
# relevant hosts. Service nova-compute must be restarted as last service.
# Therefore nova-compute service is restarted in separate step.
