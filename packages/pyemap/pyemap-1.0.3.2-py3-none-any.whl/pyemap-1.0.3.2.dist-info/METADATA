PyeMap (pronounced Pie-Map) is a python package for automatic identification and visualization of electron and hole transfer pathways in proteins. 
PyeMap analysis happens in 3 steps. The first step is parsing a PDB or CIF file provided by the user or fetched from the RCSB database. 
The next step is constructing the graph theory model of the protein crystal structure. Finally, the shortest paths between a 
specified electron/hole source to the surface or to a specified electron/hole acceptor can be calculated.

All PyeMap wheels distributed on PyPI are 3-BSD licensed.
