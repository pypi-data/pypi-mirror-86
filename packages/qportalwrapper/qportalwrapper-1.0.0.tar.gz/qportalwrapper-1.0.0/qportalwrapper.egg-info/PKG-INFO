Description: # QPortalWrapper: an unofficial Python wrapper around the Q Portal for grades. #
        This library provides programmatic access to grades on the Q Portal.
        You can write scripts or applications that interface with Q and fetch grades.
        
        Example usage:
        ```python
        from qportalwrapper.qportalwrapper import QPortalWrapper, QError
        
        # Connect to the Q portal
        conn = QPortalWrapper("Q_URL")
        
        try:
            # Login
            conn.login("USER", "PASS")
        except QError as e:
            # Catch an error (failed login, etc.)
            print(e.msg)
        
        # Get a list of viewable students
        students = conn.get_students()
        print(students)
        
        # Select a student to view
        conn.select_student(students[0].id)
        
        # View student's assignment grades
        print(conn.get_assignments()[0])
        ```
        
        Full docs can be found by running `python3 -c "from qportalwrapper.qportalwrapper import QPortalWrapper; help(QPortalWrapper)"`
        in the root repository folder.
        
        QPortalWrapper is currently in **alpha**. Confirmed working features:
        - Login
        - Student fetching
        - Assignment fetching
        - Progress report fetching
        
        Other features are WIP and should be added soon. Help adding functions would be greatly appreciated.
