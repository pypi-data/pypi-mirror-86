I always kind of skipped writing a vector implementation for my programs or just hacked a quick solution together, which is (obviously) not optimal, so I decided to write a proper one I could use in all of my projects. My goal was to make it flexible and easy to use. Since ShiVec is the first project of mine that I want to publish, it is also a way for me to learn about developing and publishing software, so feedback is highly appreciated :)
