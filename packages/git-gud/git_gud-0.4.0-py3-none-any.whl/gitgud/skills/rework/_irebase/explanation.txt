This practice level will familiarize you with interactive rebasing.
>>>
Rebasing interactively makes it easier to change the effect of running "git rebase".
>>>
When you run "git rebase -i <commit-ish>", git will open a text editor to show you a list of commits.
>>>
For example, "git rebase -i HEAD~4" allows you to change the last 4 commits with the text editor.
>>
In the text editor, you're able to edit the list. You can reorder and drop certain commits among other things.
>>>
For example, you might start with this text file:
----------------------
pick 321cc87 One
pick acf91d9 Two
pick 2d7f421 Three
----------------------
>>>
By changing it to this, the commits are now in reverse order.
----------------------
pick 2d7f421 Three
pick acf91d9 Two
pick 321cc87 One
----------------------
>>>
To reorder a commit, change the order of the lines like you see above
To omit a commit, replace "pick" with "drop" or delete the entire line
>>>
This should be enough to get started on the level. Good luck!
