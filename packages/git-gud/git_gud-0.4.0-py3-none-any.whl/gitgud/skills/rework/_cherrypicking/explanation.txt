This practice level will familiarize with you with the command git cherry-pick.
>>>
Cherry-pick in git allows you to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD).
>>>
It appears in the form of "git cherry-pick <commit 1> <commit 2> <...>"
>>>
To use this properly, lets say we have some work in our branch that we want to copy into master. While we can accomplish this through a rebase, we can also do this through cherry-pick.
Let's say there are 3 commits in the branch: commit 2, commit 3, and commit 4. If we want to copy commit 2 and commit 4 into master then we would use the command "git cherry-pick 2 4".
>>>
Now lets say there are 3 branches: bugFix, side, and another. bugFix contains commit 2 and commit 3, side contains commit 4 and commit 5, another contains commit 6 and commit 7.
To complete this level, copy the work from commit 3, commit 4, and commit 7 from the three branches into master.
