Now that we've initialized a repo, we're going to take the Git Gud training wheels off and let you focus on Git.

Here are the most important commands that you should commit to memory:
    git gud goal
    git gud status
    git gud explain
    git gud test
    git gud load next

If you ever get stuck on a level, you can look at the solution
    git gud solution

And if you need help remembering commands, you can always run these
    git gud help
    git gud <command> --help (replace <command> with the command you need help with)

Run "git gud help" now just to see what it's like

Good luck!
