Now that you have a repo, you're going to want to start using it.
>>>
As stated before, repos are used to keep track of your changes.
Your changes are stored in what's known as a commit.
>>>
Commits are called "commits" because you use them to "commit" your changes.
>>>
You can think of committing your changes as another way to save your files, just a little more advanced.
Among other things, you need to manually add your files to commits, and each commit comes with a message.
>>>
Commits are also ordered, so there is naturally a first commit. Most people call this their "Initial commit".
>>>
Making your first commit will look something like this:
Create a file, it can be named anything, and it can have anything in it.
Type "git add myfile.txt" to add your file (in this case, the name of the file is "myfile.txt")
Type "git commit -m "Initial commit""
>>>
After that, you'll have your first commit, and later on you'll be able to go back to it to see what changes you've made
