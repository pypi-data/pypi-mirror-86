A Git repository (repo for short) is where Git stores all of it's information.
Running "git init" will make a folder in your current directory called ".git".
>>>
The ".git" folder contains a lot of information that git can use to help you
manage different versions of your code.
Managing different versions of your code is why Git is called a "Version Control System"
>>>
For now, it's fine to know that you don't need to ever look in the ".git" dirctory.
What's more important is that you know what git does.
Among other things, these are some of the things you'll work with throughout the game:
Commits, branches, remotes, tags, heads, merges and rebases.
>>>
For now, type "git init" to make a git repo for this folder
The output of "git status" will change once you're in a git repo
