## v0.2.1

Small fix in the setup script. The buf prevented pip from working.


## v0.2.0

In this release we focussed on improving and finalizing the object
oriented OpenGL interface ``vispy.gloo``. Some major (backward
incompatible) changes were done. However, from this release we consider
the ``vispy.gloo`` package relatively stable and we try to minimize
backward incompatibilities.

Changes in more detail:

- ``vispy.oogl`` is renamed to ``vispy.gloo``
- ``vispy.gl`` is moved to ``vispy.gloo.gl`` since most users will
  use gloo to interface with OpenGL.
- Improved (and thus changed) several parts of the gloo API.
- Some parts of gloo were refactored and should be more robust.
- Much better coverage of the test suite.
- Compatibility with Python 2.6 (Jerome Kieffer)
- More examples and a gallery on the website to show them off. 


## v0.1.0

First release. We have an initial version of the object oriented interface
to OpenGL, called `vispy.oogl`.
