        ## How to use
        
        Its pretty simple to use. Create a instance of the `player` class and let your code run enclosed in a with statement with the instance.
        
        ``` python
        
          from euphony import player
          mozart = player.player()
        
          with mozart:
              for i in range(1000000000):
                  pass
          # plays music while the code runs
        ```
        
        That's all ~!
