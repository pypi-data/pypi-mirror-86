## What does ezprez do?

Let's you write simple python scripts to generate web presentations

## Features & Roadmap

### Simple class based api

The api iteself uses native python classes to create presentations in a short script that's easily editable

### No web experience needed

Since this is a pure python API you can write web presentations without knowing HTML

### Backed on a reliable web framework

Webslides powers this project and is a well-tested and stable web framework.

## Why should I use ezprez?

Ezprez is the simplest API for writing web presentations without needing explicit knowledge of web development. If you are looking to create powerpoint style presentations [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [the google slides api](https://developers.google.com/slides/quickstart/python) is better suited for this job.

## Who is ezprez for?

- People who want an easy way to create web presentations without editing html
- People who know python but not web development technologies
