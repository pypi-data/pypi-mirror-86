## Motivation

When working with people that are not in your local timezone, the available
resources are the usual webpages that only show _one_ hour at a time, which
is pretty inconvenient.

With this script you can quickly compare a full day of your timezone against
a foreign one.

## Quickstart

Install with pip

```bash
pip install timezone-converter
```

Run

```bash
timezone-converter {timezone}
```

## Available timezones

`$ timezone-converter --list`
