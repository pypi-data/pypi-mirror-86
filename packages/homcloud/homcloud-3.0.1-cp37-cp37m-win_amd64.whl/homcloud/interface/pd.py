        Args:
            pointcloud (numpy.ndarray): Point cloud data. Each row
                represents a single point.
            weight (bool): If False, the pointcloud has no weight. If True,
                the last column of the pointcloud ndarray is regarded as
                weights. Please note that the weight paramters of points
                should be the square of their own radii.
            no_squared (bool): By default, all birth/death times are squared.
                If no_squared is True, all computed birth/death times are
                not squared.
            subsets (list[int] or bool or None):
                This parameter is used to compute relative homology.
                This parameter allows you to analyze the interspace structures
                between two or more objects in your pointcloud.

                If `subsets` is None, normal persistent homology is computed.

                If `subsets` is a list of integers whose length is the same
                as the number of points, the points are grouped
                by the integers and the gaps in the points in the same
                group is filled. The integer -1 in this list means
                that the point does not belong to any group.

                If subsets is True, the last column of `pointcloud` is regarded
                as the list of group id.
            check_acyclicity (bool):
                Checks the acyclicity of each grouped points in subsets
                if True. This parameter is used only if `subsets` parameter
                is used.
            algorithm (string or None): The name of the algorithm.
                An appropriate algorithm is
                automatically selected if None is given.

                The following algorithms are available:

                * "phat-twist"
                * "phat-chunk-parallel"
                * "dipha"

                In many cases, the parameter should be `None`.
            vertex_symbols (list[string] or None): The names of vertices.
                The names are used to represent some simplices, such as
                birth/death simplices or optimal volumes.

                If None is given, vertices are automatically named by
                "0", "1", "2", ...
            parallels (int): The number of threads used for the computation.
                This parameter is used only if "dipha" algorithm is used.
            save_to (string): The file path which the computation result is
                saved into. You can load the saved data by
                ``homcloud.interface.PDList(FILE_PATH)``.
                Saving the result is recommended since the computation cost is
                often expensive.
            save_suppl_info (bool): Various supplimentary information is saved to
                the file `save_to`. The default is True. This information is
                required to show birth and death pixels and optimal volumes.
                If you do not use such HomCloud's functionality and you want to
                reduce the size of the file, please set the argument ``False``.
                If False, only birth and death times are stored to the file.
            save_boundary_map (bool):
                The boundary map constructed by the given pointcloud is saved
                if this parameter is True. The boundary map is used to
                compute volume optimal cycles.
            periodicity (tuple[tuple[float, float], tuple[float, float], tuple[float, float]] or None):
                Periodic boundary condition.
            save_phtrees (bool): The PH-trees for (n-1)st PH is saved if True.
                Use meth:`PD.load_phtrees` to load the PH trees.
        Returns:
            The :class:`PDList` object computed from the pointcloud.

                For example, if your array is 2D and you want to make

                Any periodic structure is not used if None.
