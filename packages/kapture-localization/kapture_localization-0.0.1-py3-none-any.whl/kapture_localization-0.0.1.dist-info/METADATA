Overview
========

kapture-localization is a **toolbox** in which you will find
implementations for various localization related algorithms. It strongly
relies on the [kapture](https://github.com/naver/kapture) package for
data representation and manipulation.

The localization algorithms aims to do:

1.  **mapping**,

2.  **localization** and

3.  **benchmarking** (image retrieval for visual localization).

It works on Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS.

structure
=========

The directories are organised as follow:

    ├── kapture_localization/  # package (library)
    ├── pipeline/              # main programs scheduling all steps needed in localization pipelines
    ├── samples/               # some sample data
    ├── tests/                 # unit tests
    └── tools/                 # sub programs involved in the pipeline

The *kapture-localization* toolbox provides both :

-   Python **package** (`kapture_localization/`),

-   Python **executable scripts** (`pipeline/` & `tools/`).

There is basically 3 pipelines, for:

1.  mapping,

2.  localization and

3.  image retrieval benchmark (global sfm, local sfm, pose
    approximation).

Installation
============

You can either install using docker, pip or from the source code
manually. Basically, you will need python (&gt;=3.6) and Colmap
(&gt;=3.6) to be installed, and then you can

    pip install kapture-localization

See [doc/installation.adoc](doc/installation.adoc) for more details.

Tutorial
========

See the [doc/tutorial](doc/tutorial.adoc) for a short introduction to:

-   mapping pipeline

-   localization pipeline

-   image retrieval benchmark (global sfm, local sfm, pose
    approximation)

Contributing
============

There are many ways to contribute to the *kapture-localization* project:

-   provide feedback and suggestions of improvements,

-   submit bug reports in the project bug tracker,

-   implement a feature or bug-fix for an outstanding issue,

-   provide scripts to create data in kapture format (e.g. local/global
    feature extraction),

-   propose a new feature and implement it.
