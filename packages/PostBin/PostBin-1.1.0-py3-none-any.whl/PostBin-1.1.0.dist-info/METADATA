# PostBin
A simple package that allows you to post to haste services.

## Features:
* "fallback" system, meaning your pastes always succeed
* async and sync functionality
* literally instant setup - see [execution](#Execution)

## Why this exists
There's no real need for a full-fledged module for simply creating pastes. So, I think a quick 2 function module
does the trick far easier.

*Note: v2 would like to disagree*

## [backwards] Compatability
While postbin tries to support all versions, nothing is guaranteed.
So far, we actively support python 3.6 through to 3.9, however **you should check the :white_check_mark: or :x: next to the most recent commit** and find your version. if its a check mark, it is supported and will work.

Alternatively, install through pip (below) - pip releases are always guaranteed to be stable on 3.6-3.9.

## Installing
from pip: 
```shell script
$ [python3 -m] pip install postbin
```
or from git:
```shell script
$ [python3 -m] pip install git+https://github.com/dragdev-studios/PostBin.git
# OR
$ git clone https://github.com/dragdev-studios/PostBin.git
$ cd postbin
$ python[3] setup.py build && python[3] setup.py install
```

## Execution
from within a script:
```python
import postbin
# Async app
async def main():
    url = await postbin.postAsync(f"FooBar Bazz")
    print(f"Your paste is located at {url}")


# Sync app
def mainSync(): 
    url = postbin.postSync(f"FooBar Bazz 2")
    print(f"Your paste is located at {url}")
```

## Want your haste service to be a fallback?
Make sure all of the following are true:

1.  `POST /documents` with a text/plain body returns JSON `{"key": "url_part"}` or `{"url": "new_url"}`
2. Ratelimit is greater than or equal to 5/5s
3. Ratelimit response is JSON (html is only allowed in extreme circumstances, like if cloudflare responds instead.).
If `x-ratelimit-reset-after` response headers can be used in replacement of body if required.
4. `GET /raw/:key` returns the text/plain content of the key
5. `HEAD /:key` or `HEAD /:raw/key` or `HEAD /documents[/:key]` returns a 200 response, or other information 
response regarding the status of the service, rather than 404 for not found/

If those are all met, open a PR modifying `_FALLBACKS` to add your site __to the end of the list__.
