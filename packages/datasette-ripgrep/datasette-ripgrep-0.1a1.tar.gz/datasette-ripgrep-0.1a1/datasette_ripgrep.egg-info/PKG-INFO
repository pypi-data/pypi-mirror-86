        HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL: Configurable Datasette plugin running ripgrep
        
        This plugin is a weird experiment. It probably shouldn't even be a Datasette plugin at all! Do not attempt to run this on a public Datasette instance.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this plugin in the same environment as Datasette.
        
            $ datasette install datasette-ripgrep
        
        The `rg` executable needs to be installed such that it can be run by this tool.
        
        ## Usage
        
        This plugin requires configuration: it needs to a `path` setting so that it knows where to run searches:
        
        ```json
        {
            "plugins": {
                "datasette-ripgrep": {
                    "path": "/path/to/your/files"
                }
            }
        }
        ```
        
        The plugin will add an interface at `/-/ripgrep` for running searches.
        
        ## Development
        
        To set up this plugin locally, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd datasette-ripgrep
            python3 -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
