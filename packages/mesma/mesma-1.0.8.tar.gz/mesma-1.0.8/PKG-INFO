Summary: MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis) is a common unmixing technique in the fieldof remote sensing. This suite of processing tools allows you to unmix your image with MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...) and post-process the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, soft to hard classification).

        About MESMA
        ###########
        
        MESMA is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package that implements the MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral
        Mixture Analysis) unmixing algorithm in the field of Remote Sensing.
        
        It is based on VIPER Tools: a software package written for ENVI/IDL and released in 2007.
        Several updates have been released since and now it has been ported to PyQGIS in the period 2017 - 2020.
        The original VIPER Tools is now split over two python/QGIS tools: **Spectral Library Tool** and **MESMA**.
        
        **Spectral Library Tool** provides the following:
         - Creating spectral libraries interactively (selecting spectra from an image or using regions of interest) and managing
           the metadata (developed by HU Berlin)
         - Optimizing spectral libraries with Iterative Endmember Selection, Ear-Masa-Cob or CRES
         - Website: <https://spectral-libraries.readthedocs.io>
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/spectral-libraries
        
        **MESMA** provides the following:
         - Running SMA and MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...)
         - Post-processing of the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, ...)
         - Website: <https://mesma.readthedocs.io>
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma
        
        The software has now been developed in the open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.
