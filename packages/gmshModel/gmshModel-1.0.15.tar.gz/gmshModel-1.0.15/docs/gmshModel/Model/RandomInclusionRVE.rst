RandomInclusionRVE
==================
The RandomInclusionRVE class provides a class definition for a generation of RVEs
with randomly placed inclusions. The class inherits from the InclusionRVE class
and extends it in order to specify the remaining placeholder methods of
the GenericModel. Methods to create the geometry, define refinement information
and additional information for required boolean operations and physical groups
are part of the class.
