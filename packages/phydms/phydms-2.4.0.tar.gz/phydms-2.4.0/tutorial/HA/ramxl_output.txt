RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file


This is the RAxML Master Pthread

This is RAxML Worker Pthread Number: 1


This is RAxML version 7.7.6 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on August 29 2013.

With greatly appreciated code contributions by:
Andre Aberer (HITS)
Simon Berger (HITS)
Nick Pattengale (Sandia)

Alignment has 313 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.00%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
