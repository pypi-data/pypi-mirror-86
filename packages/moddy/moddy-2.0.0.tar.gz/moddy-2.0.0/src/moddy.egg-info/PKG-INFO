        Moddy is a discrete event simulator for concept analysis written in python.
        
        System models are written in python. The model behaviour can be event based, sequentially or a combination of both. 
        
        Moddy generates sequence diagram with timing information, model structure graphs, 
        finite state machine graphs and trace tables from the simulation.
        
        
        Typical applications are:
        
        * Modelling communication protocols
        * Modelling highly distributed computer systems
        
        
        Please read the `Moddy Online Documentation <https://klauspopp.github.io/Moddy>`_.
        
        
        Moddy comes with an interactive viewer for sequence diagrams where you can dynamically adjust the time scale.
        Here is a screenshot of Moddy Interactive Viewer,  
        better see `Online Viewer Demo <https://klauspopp.github.io/Moddy/_static/2_sergw.html>`_.
