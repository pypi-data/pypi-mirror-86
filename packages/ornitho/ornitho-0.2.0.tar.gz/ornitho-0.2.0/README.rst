Installing
----------
The project is published on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ornitho>`__, and can be install using pip or any other package manager:

``$ pip install ornitho``

Manual installation can be done with following command:

``$ pip install .``

Usage
-----
Before the client can be used  **consumer_key**, **consumer_secret**, **user_email**, **user_pw** and **api_base** must be set:

.. code-block:: python

    import ornitho

    ornitho.consumer_key = "CONSUMER_KEY"
    ornitho.consumer_secret = "CONSUMER_SECRET"
    ornitho.user_email = "USER_MAIL"
    ornitho.user_pw = "USER_PASSWORD"
    ornitho.api_base = "https://www.ornitho.de/api/"

The client can then be used.

Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Following code shows how to get all observation from ornitho.de between 01.10.2019 and 31.10.2019:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import ornitho

    ornitho.consumer_key = os.environ.get("ORNITHO_CONSUMER_KEY")
    ornitho.consumer_secret = os.environ.get("ORNITHO_CONSUMER_SECRET")
    ornitho.user_email = os.environ.get("ORNITHO_USER_EMAIL")
    ornitho.user_pw = os.environ.get("ORNITHO_USER_PW")
    ornitho.api_base = "https://www.ornitho.de/api/"
    
    resp = ornitho.Observation.search_all(period_choice="range", date_from="01.10.2019", date_to="31.10.2019")
    print(f"Found {len(resp)} observations between 01.10.2019 and 31.10.2019")
