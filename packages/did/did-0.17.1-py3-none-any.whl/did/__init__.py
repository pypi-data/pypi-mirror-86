What did you do last week, month, year?

Comfortably gather status report data (e.g. list of committed
changes) for given week, month, quarter, year or selected date
range. By default all available stats for this week are reported.
Detailed documentation available at http://did.readthedocs.org/.

The `stats`_ module contains the core of the stats gathering
functionality. Some basic functionality like exceptions, config,
user and date handling is placed in the `base`_ module. Generic
utilities can be found in the `utils`_ module. Option parsing
and other command line stuff resides in the `cli`_ module.
