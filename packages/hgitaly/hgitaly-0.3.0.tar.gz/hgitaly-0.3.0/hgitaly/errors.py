    One minor goal is that the caller can use this with a single statement::

    to avoid this::

    This helper method saves at most 3 lines of code, and that makes a
    difference for repetitive error treatment. It's also good for
    uniformity.

    The default value for `log_level` is based on the assumption that
    the client should have the means to perform calls that don't end up
    in gRPC errors, be it by before hand knowledge or by using calls that
    have a specified return for missing content. Still, ``log_level`` is
    provided for cases where the server would know that warnings are too much.
