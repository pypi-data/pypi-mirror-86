The files in this directory are traduction files. 

If you want to add/supress traductions, follow this procedure:

1. Add your modifications in the code : mark the strings subject to
   translations thanks to the translate() or tr() methods.
2. Update the \*.ts file to signify the new changes (command "lupdate app.pro").
3. If you need to, add the traductions manually thanks to the Qt Linguist UI.
   This will modify the \*.ts files.
4. Compile the \*.ts to obtain the files loaded by the code, the \*.qm files
   (command "lrelease app.pro").

Note that the emplacement of the traduction files must be told to the qt main 
configuration file (here a \*.pro).
