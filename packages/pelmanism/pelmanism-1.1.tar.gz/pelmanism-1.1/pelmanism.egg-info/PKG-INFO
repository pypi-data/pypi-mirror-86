        import pelmanism
        pelmanism.main()
        ```
        
        If `$HOME/.local/bin` is included in your `$PATH`, you can start the
        game directly with typing `pelmanism` in a terminal.

        ## Modifications:
        
        - To play the game with your own pictures, simply replace the `png` files
          in the cards directory by your own.
          
        - To change the number of cards, adjust `Nx` and `Ny` in `pelmanism.py`.
        
        - To change the size of the cards, adjust `thumbsize` in `pelmanism.py`.
