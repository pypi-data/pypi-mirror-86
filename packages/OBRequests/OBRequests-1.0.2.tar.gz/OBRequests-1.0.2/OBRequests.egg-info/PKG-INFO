Description: ## Welcome to OBRequests!
        
        OBRequests was created to eliminate common boilerplate code I'd find myself writing when using HTTP libraries.
        This library aims to simplify & remove repetitive code from writing HTTP requests without compromising performance.
        
        ### Features:
        - Full HTTP coverage.
        - Asynchronous & synchronous support.
        - Easy to use with an object-oriented design.
        - Unit testing.
        
        ### Install
        - Pip: ``pip3 install OBRequests``
        - Git: ``pip3 install git+https://github.com/WardPearce/OBRequests.git``
