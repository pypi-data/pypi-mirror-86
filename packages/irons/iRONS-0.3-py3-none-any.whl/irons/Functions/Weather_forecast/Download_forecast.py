    Input:
        originating_centre = specifies the origin of the data, usually as the 
                             WMO centre identifier, either specified as number 
                             or 4 character abbreviation as listed in:

        system = labels the version of the operational forecast system for 
                 seasonal forecast related products.
        weather_variables = specifies the meteorological parameter of a field. 
                            List  of all parameters: https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db/
        years = list of years of forecast base time 
        months = list of months of forecast base time 
        days = list of days of forecast base time
        leadtime_hours = The forecast time step in hours from the forecast base 
                         time
        grid_resolution = specifies the target grid resolution in degrees. 
                          The first number denotes the east-west resolution 
                          (longitude) and the second denotes the north-south 
                          resolution (latitude).    
        coordinates = specifies the coordinated of the desired area of the data
                      to be retrieved. North/West/South/East in decimal degrees
        file_format = format of the file containing the seasonal weather
                      forecast data
        folder_path = path to the folder where the file will be downloaded
        file_name_end = end of the name the downloaded file
