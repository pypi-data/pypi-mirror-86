To install:

1. Use 'make install' to install gvar into the system's standard library
	(as opposed to the user's library; use 'make install-user' to install
	to the system library). The installation process will install the
	numpy Python module if it is not present.

	N.B. Rather than using make and the makefile, one can instead use
	standard python installation tools: run 'pip install .' to install
	to the system library (or 'pip install . --user' to install to
	the user's directory) from within the top directory.

	N.B. gvar uses cython to convert .pyx files to .c files. The .c files
	are included in the distribution so cython is not required to install
	gvar. To force regeneration of the .c files set USE_CYTHON=True in
	setup.py.

	The gvar code works for Python 2.6 and 2.7, and Python 3.2-3.6. It
	does not work for Python versions 2.5.X or earlier. It has not been tested
	for Python 3.0 and 3.1, but likely works at least with the latter. Some
	of the tests don't work with Python 2.6.

2. (Optional) Run 'make tests' to test your installation of gvar if you
	are using Python 2.7 or later (it doesn't work as well with Python 2.6).
	The tests have been successful if the output ends with "OK".
	Some tests involve random numbers and so may occasionally --- less than
	1 in 100 runs --- fail due to rare multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the
	tests if they do fail. Contact g.p.lepage@cornell.edu if there are
	persistent, frequent failures.

	N.B. The tests can also be run directly using Python's unittest module:
	"python -m unittest discover".

4. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files/directories.

5. (Optional) Use 'make run-examples' to run the example files in
   directory examples/. These are short, annotated examples, suitable
   for tinkering.

To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' (probably) uninstalls most of what was installed. It
    uses pip uninstall.
