Description: #Fractalize NLP
        A group of Modules encompassing common components that are used in all Fractalize NLP products and deployments
        
        ###string_generators####
        Module that enables encoding of structured domain knowledge into a conditional processing graph. The conditional
        processing graph is used to generate random samples of unstructured strings which represent natural language
        invocations of the underlying domain knowledge
        
        ### __Building the package__
        To build a deployable binary including soruce files execute:
        ```console
        $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        This will produce fractalize_nlp/dist/fractalize_nlp-<version>-py3.7.egg
        
        Upload the package to PyPi using 
        ### __Running Test Suite__
        To run the test suite, run either:
        ```console
        $ pytest 
        ```
        or
        ```console
        $ coverage run -m pytest
        ```
        To generate the coverage report, the test suite must be invoked via coverage first. Then, run:
        ```console
        $ coverage report -m <module_name>/<relevant_script>.py
        ```
        To generate the full coverage report, run:
        ```console
        $ coverage report -m
        ```
