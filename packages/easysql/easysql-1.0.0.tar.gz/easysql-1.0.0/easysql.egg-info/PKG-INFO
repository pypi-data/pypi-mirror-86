        ## Overview
        #### EasySQL is a dependency-free, pythonic module to make your SQL projects easy and fast.

        ## Conditionals
        Conditionals can be imported directly from easysql.
        ```python 
        from easysql import SQLConditional
        ```
        Conditionals are initiated with a string representation of a condition. 
        ```python
        from easysql import SQLConditional as sqc
        condition = sqc('age > 17')
        ```
        To join conditionals, use `&, |, ~` for `AND, OR, NOT`, respecitvely. When compared, a new conditional is returned.
        ```python
        from easysql import SQLConditional as sqc
        
        condition = sqc('age > 17')
        condition2 = sqc('age < 100')
        
        condition3 = condition & condition2 # AND
        condition4 = condition | condition2 # OR
        condition5 = ~condition # NOT
        ```
