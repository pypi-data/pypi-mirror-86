        ## What's Here
        
        ### Analyzers
        
        rac_es includes analyzers which provide custom processing of text fields.
        
        ### Documents
        
        The Elasticsearch Document definitions in rac_es match the four main object
        types in the RAC data model: Agents, Collections, Objects and Terms. In addition
        to these definitions, rac_es provides custom search and save methods for these
        Documents, including bulk save and delete methods.
