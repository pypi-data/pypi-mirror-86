        ### Install
        
        The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
        [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
        `yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Move to jupyterlab_primehub directory
        
        # Install dependencies
        jlpm
        # Build Typescript source
        jlpm build
        # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jupyter labextension install .
        # Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
        jlpm build
        # Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.
        
        ```bash
        # Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
        jlpm watch
        # Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
        jupyter lab --watch
        ```
        
        Now every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).
        
        ### Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        
        jupyter labextension uninstall @infuseai/jupyterlab-primehub
        ```
