    """
    Tokenization converts input text to streams of tokens, where each token is a separate word, punctuation sign,
    number/amount, date, etc.

    A Tokenizer object converts the corpus documents into a stream of:

       * _tokens_: tokens occurring in those documents. Each token is characterized by:
          * _token_id_: unique token identifier;
          * _sent_id_: unique sentence identifier. The id of the sentence the token occurs in;
          * _para_id_: unique paragraph identifier. The id of the paragraph the token occurs in;
          * _doc_id_: unique document identifier. The id of the document the token occurs in;
          * _text_: the text of the token;
          * a large variety of _optional meta-information_ (e.g. PoS tag, dep tag, lemma, stem, ...);
       * _sentences_ : sentences occurring in those documents. Each sentence is characterized by:
          * _sent_id_: unique sentence identifier;
          * _para_id_: unique paragraph identifier. The id of the paragraph the sentence occurs in;
          * _doc_id_: unique document identifier. The id of the document the sentence occurs in;
          * _text_: the text of the sentence;
          * a large variety of _optional meta-information_ (e.g.lemma, stem, ...);
       * _paragraphs_: sentences occurring in those documents. Each paragraph is characterized by:
          * _para_id_: unique paragraph identifier;
          * _doc_id_: unique document identifier. The id of the document the paragraph occurs in;
          * _text_: the text of the paragraph;
          * a large variety of _optional meta-information_ (e.g.lemma, stem, ...);
       * _documents_: Each document is characterized by:
          * _doc_id_: unique document identifier;
          * _text_: the text of the document;
          * a large variety of _optional meta-information_ (e.g.lemma, stem, ...);

    A Tokenizer object is also able to retrieve frequent n-grams to be considered as unique tokens.

    For each record (token, sentence, paragraph, document) are stored some metadata.
    You can edit the config.ini file to change those stored by default.

    In order to run tokenization you need to provide a Iterable[dict], where each document is a dict
    and has a key where it stores the text of the document. By default the text key is 'text', you can change it
    editing the config.ini file.

    For each document in your corpus, all key/value data (except for text key) are added as metadata to
    that document records. (e.g. title, author, ...).
