        Calculates frequent n-grams in the corpus. They will be considered as unique tokens during the Tokenization task. <br/>

        Args:
           docs_in (Iterable[Dict[str, str]]): Stream of input json documents as dicts. <br/> Each document must have a key where the text of the document is stored. Frequent n-grams will be calculated by scrolling this stream.

           corpus_threshold (int, optional, default=50): Filters n-grams that have a corpus frequency greater than corpus_threshold.
           doc_threshold (int, optional, default=0): Filters n-grams that have in frequency greater than doc_threshold. <br/> The frequency of an n-gram in the corpus is the sum of the frequency of that n-gram in documents where the ngram occurs at least doc_thresold times.
           len_gram (int, optional, default=3): The size of the first and the last token that make up n-grams must be at least 'len_gram'.

                   Example:
                   len_gram = 5

           include (Tuple[str, ...], optional, default=None): Include a list of arbitrary n-grams.
           replace (bool, optional, default=True): If True, replaces a n-gram with its tokens separated by '_'. <br/> Else, concatenates a new token, made merging the n-gram tokens with '_', to the n-gram.
