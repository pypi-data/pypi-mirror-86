        This project groups the input sentences into specific topic categories and
        uses custom named entity classification, our machine learning model identifies
        words belonging to a particular topic. This custom named entity recognition is
         done using Spacy library.  One of top of it we do aspect based
        sentiment analysis for each given topics. For this currently we have leveraged 
        NLTK vader library.
