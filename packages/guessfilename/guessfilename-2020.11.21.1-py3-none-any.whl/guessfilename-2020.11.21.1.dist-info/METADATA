Usage:
    guessfilename.py [<options>] <list of files>

This little Python script tries to rename files according to pre-defined rules.

It does this with several methods: first, the current file name is analyzed and
any ISO date/timestamp and filetags are re-used. Secondly, if the parsing of the
file name did not lead to any new file name, the content of the file is analyzed.

You have to adapt the rules in the Python script to meet your requirements.
The default rule-set follows the filename convention described on
