# The string sets originate from: Wilson B, Slater H, Kikuchi Y, Milne AE,

# Learning in Macaque and Marmoset Monkeys. J Neurosci 33:18825â€“18835.

# Macaques:
# *Habituation* was done as follows: 9 strings per minute, inter-string
# interval was 4 s. For the duration of 2 hours in the afternoon the day
# before testing, and 10 min. immediately before testing (see 'Habituation
# phase' on page 18828). Hence each subject heard 9 * 60 * 2 = 1080 (afternoon
# day before) and then 10 * 9 = 90 ( just before test) habituation strings.
# In total: 1170. There are 9 habituation strings, so each one was played 130
# times.
#
# *Testing* was done as follows: randomly selected test string of the eight
# (correct or violation; see below Fam, Novel and Viol strings) strings was
# individually presented (4 times each, for a total of 32 testing trials; at
# an average rate of 1/min; interstring intervals ranged between 45 and
# 75 s).
#
# Marmosets:
# "Four marmosets were available for study, thus, to obtain sufficient data
# for analysis they were each tested four times. Each testing run was
# separated by at least 1 week and followed an identical procedure to the
# macaque experiment, including a habituation and testing phase."
