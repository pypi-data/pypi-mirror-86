pgxnclient -- commands dispatcher

The script dispatches commands based on the name, e.g. upon the command::

    pgxn foo --arg blah ...

a script called pgxn-foo is searched and executed with remaining arguments.

The commands are looked for by default in the dir ``libexec/pgxnclient/``
sibling of the directory containing this script, then are looked for in the
``PATH`` directories.
