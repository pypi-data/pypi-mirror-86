Who has contributed to the PGXN client?
=======================================

Daniele Varrazzo

    He rushed to implement a client before David could do it in Perl!

David Wheeler

    He is the PGXN mastermind: a lot of helpful design discussions.

Peter Eisentraut

    First implementation of tarball support. Auto-sudo is not a good idea, I
    got it.

Hitoshi Harada

    Tricky installation corner cases.

Andrey Popp

    Make selection. Helped the program not to suck on BSD!

Also thank you everybody for the useful discussions on the PGXN mailing list,
bug reports, proofreading the docs and the general support to the project.
