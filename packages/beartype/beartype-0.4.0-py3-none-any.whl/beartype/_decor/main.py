**Beartype decorator.**

This private submodule implements the core :func:`beartype` decorator as well
as ancillary functions called by that decorator. The :mod:`beartype.__init__`
submodule then imports the former for importation as the public
:mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator by downstream callers -- completing the
virtuous cycle of code life.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Reduce @beartype to a noop if the passed callable was decorated by the
#@typing.no_type_check decorator, which we can trivially detect at runtime via
#the "__no_type_check__" dunder attribute set on that callable set to True.

#FIXME: Ensure that *ALL* calls to memoized callables throughout the codebase
#are called with purely positional rather than keyword arguments. Currently, we
#suspect the inverse is the case. To do so, we'll probably want to augment the
#wrapper closure returned by the @callable_cached decorator to emit non-fatal
#warnings when called with non-empty keyword arguments.
#
#Alternately, we might simply want to prohibit keyword arguments altogether by
#defining a new @callable_cached_positional decorator restricted to positional
#arguments. Right... That probably makes more sense. Make it so, ensign!
#
#Then, for generality:
#
#* Preserve the existing @callable_cached decorator as is. We won't be using
#  it, but there's little sense in destroying something beautiful.
#* Globally replace all existing "@callable_cached" substrings with
#  "@callable_cached_positional". Voila!

#FIXME: Refactor all calls the outrageously slow str.format() method embedded
#throughout the codebase with outrageously fast Python >= 3.6-specific
#f-strings: e.g.,
#    # Rather than this...
#    "{}/{}".format(root, output)
#    # ...do this everywhere.
#    f"{root}/{output}".
#
#Note that the f-string approach requires format variables and external
#variables to share the same names. Ergo, as a necessary precondition to making
#this happen, we'll need to grep through the codebase and ensure this is the
#case for all existing str.format() calls.

#FIXME: *CRITICAL EDGE CASE:* If the passed "func" is a coroutine, that
#coroutine *MUST* be called preceded by the "await" keyword rather than merely
#called as is. Detecting coroutines is trivial, thankfully: e.g.,
#
#    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
#
#Actually, shouldn't that be the more general-purpose test:
#
#    if inspect.isawaitable(func):
#
#The latter seems more correct. In any case, given that:
#
#* Modify the "CODE_CALL_CHECKED" and "CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED" snippets to
#  conditionally precede the function call with the substring "await ": e.g.,
#      CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED = '''
#          return {func_await}__beartype_func(*args, **kwargs)
#      '''
#  Note the absence of delimiting space. This is, of course, intentional.
#* Unconditionally format the "func_await" substring into both of those
#  snippets, define ala:
#      format_await = 'await ' if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func) else ''
#* Oh, and note that our defined wrapper function must also be preceded by the
#  "async " keyword. So, we'll also need to augment "CODE_SIGNATURE".
#FIXME: Unit test this extensively, please.

#FIXME: Non-critical optimization: if the active Python interpreter is already
#performing static type checking (e.g., with Pyre or mypy), @beartype should
#unconditionally reduce to a noop for the current process. Note that:
#
#* Detecting static type checking is trivial, as PEP 563 standardizes the newly
#  declared "typing.TYPE_CHECKING" boolean constant to be true only if static
#  type checking is currently occurring.
#* Detecting whether static type checking just occurred is clearly less
#  trivial and possibly even infeasible. We're unclear what exactly separates
#  the "static type checking" phase from the runtime phase performed by static
#  type checkers, but something clearly does. If all else fails, we can
#  probably attempt to detect whether the basename of the command invoked by
#  the parent process matches "(Pyre|mypy|pyright|pytype)" or... something. Of
#  course, that itself is non-trivial due to Windows, so here we are. *sigh*

#FIXME: [FEATURE] Add support for unqualified classnames, referred to as
#"forward references" in PEP 484 jargon: e.g.,
#    @beartype
#    def testemall(ride: 'Lightning') -> 'Lightning': return ride
#    class Lightning(object): pass
#To do so, note that the fully-qualified name of the decorated callable is
#trivially obtainable as "func.__module__". So, this should be trivial --
#except that there exists a common edge case: *BUILTIN TYPES* (e.g., "dict"),
#which are also unqualified but signify something completely different.
#
#Fortunately, differentiating these two cases isn't terribly arduous. Note that
#the trivial expression "set(dir(builtins))", which yields a set of the names
#of all builtins, *NEARLY* gets us there. Since that set contains the names of
#builtins that are *NOT* types (e.g., sum(), super()), however, we then need to
#filter that expression for all types: e.g., something resembling:
#
#    import builtins
#    _BUILTIN_TYPE_NAMES = set(
#        getattr(builtins, builtin_name)
#        for builtin_name in dir(builtins)
#        if isinstance(getattr(builtins, builtin_name), type)
#    )
#
#I can confirm that works, but it also calls getattr() excessively. Perhaps
#there's an "inspect" function that yields not simply the names but also the
#objects defined by a passed module. *shrug*

#FIXME: Emit one non-fatal warning for each annotated type that is either:
#
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableType".
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes".
#
#Both cases imply user-side misconfiguration, but not sufficiently awful enough
#to warrant fatal exceptions. Moreover, emitting warnings rather than
#exceptions enables end users to unconditionally disable all unwanted warnings,
#whereas no such facilities exist for unwanted exceptions.
#FIXME: Validate all tuple annotations to be non-empty *EXCLUDING*
#"beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes", which is intentionally empty.
#FIXME: Unit test the above edge case.

#FIXME: Reduce tuples containing only one item to those items as is for
#efficiency: e.g.,
#
#    # This...
#    @beartype
#    def slowerfunc(dumbedgecase: (int,))
#
#    # ...should be exactly as efficient as this.
#    def fasterfunc(idealworld: int)

#FIXME: Add support for all possible kinds of parameters. @beartype currently
#supports most but *NOT* all types. Specifically:
#
#* Type-check variadic keyword arguments. Currently, only variadic positional
#  arguments are type-checked. When doing so, remove the
#  "Parameter.VAR_KEYWORD" type from the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Type-check positional-only arguments under Python >= 3.8. Note that, since
#  C-based callables have *ALWAYS* supported positional-only arguments, the
#  "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type is defined for *ALL* Python versions
#  despite only being usable in actual Python from Python >= 3.8. In other
#  words, support for type-checking positional-only arguments should be added
#  unconditionally without reference to Python version -- we suspect, anyway.
#  When doing so, remove the "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type from the
#  "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Remove the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set entirely.

#FIXME: [FEATURE] Add support for PEP 544. First, note that this PEP defines
#protocol types as classes *DIRECTLY* subclassing the new "typing.Protocol"
#abstract base class. Classes *INDIRECTLY* subclassing that class through
#transitivity are not detected as protocols. That's nice.
#
#Second, thanks to the obscure magic of abstract base classes as implemented by
#the "ABCMeta" metaclass, all classes with the "ABCMeta" metaclass provide
#highly efficient __instancecheck__() and __subclasscheck__() dunder method
#implementations by default that successfully test arbitrary objects as
#implicitly implementing an abstract base class if those objects implement all
#abstract methods declared by that base class -- even for objects whose types
#do *NOT* explicitly subclass that base class.
#
#In theory, this means that testing whether an arbitrary object "a" satisfies
#an arbitrary protocol "B" should reduce to simply:
#
#    # Yup. Really.
#    isinstance(a, B)

#FIXME: [FEATURE] Define the following supplementary decorators:
#* @beartype.beartype_O1(), identical to the current @beartype.beartype()
#  decorator but provided for disambiguity. This decorator only type-checks
#  exactly one item from each container for each call rather than all items.
#* @beartype.beartype_On(), type-checking all items from each container for
#  each call. We have various ideas littered about GitHub on how to optimize
#  this for various conditions, but this is never going to be ideal and should
#  thus never be the default.

'''
Dictionary mapping from the name to value of all attributes internally
accessed as globals (rather than as locals externally passed as private default
parameters) in wrapping functions created and returned by the :func:`beartype`
decorator.

The names of these attributes are embedded in one or more string global
constants declared by one or more snippet submodules (e.g.,
:mod:`beartype._decor._code._codesnip`). To avoid colliding with the names of
arbitrary caller-defined parameters, these names *must* be aliased under
alternate names prefixed by ``__beartype_``.

Caveats
----------
**Attributes frequently accessed in the body of these functions should instead
be externally passed as default parameters into these functions.** This
includes the frequently accessed ``__beartypistry`` local, which is thus passed
as a private default parameter to the signatures of these functions.

# ....................{ DECORATORS                        }....................
def beartype(func):
    '''
    Decorate the passed **callable** (e.g., function, method) to validate both
    all annotated parameters passed to this callable *and* the annotated value
    returned by this callable if any.

    This decorator performs rudimentary type checking based on Python 3.x
    function annotations, as officially documented by PEP 484 ("Type Hints").
    While PEP 484 supports arbitrarily complex type composition, this decorator
    requires *all* parameter and return value annotations to be either:

    * Classes (e.g., :class:`int`, :class:`OrderedDict`).
    * Tuples of classes (e.g., ``(int, OrderedDict)``).

    If optimizations are enabled by the active Python interpreter (e.g., due to
    option ``-O`` passed to this interpreter), this decorator reduces to a
    noop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : CallableTypes
        **Non-class callable** (i.e., callable object that is *not* a class) to
        be decorated by a dynamically generated new callable wrapping this
        original callable with pure-Python type-checking.

    Returns
    ----------
    CallableTypes
        Dynamically generated new callable wrapping this original callable with
        pure-Python type-checking.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintException
        If any annotation on this callable is neither:

        * A **PEP-compliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with a
          PEP supported by :mod:`beartype`), including:

          * `PEP 484`_ types (i.e., instance or class declared by the stdlib
            :mod:`typing` module).

        * A **PEP-noncompliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with
          :mod:`beartype`-specific semantics rather than a PEP), including:

          * **Fully-qualified forward references** (i.e., strings specified as
            fully-qualified classnames).
          * **Tuple unions** (i.e., tuples containing one or more classes
            and/or forward references).
    BeartypeDecorParamNameException
        If the name of any parameter declared on this callable is prefixed by
        the reserved substring ``__beartype_``.
    BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
        If `PEP 563`_ is active for this callable and evaluating a **postponed
        annotation** (i.e., annotation whose value is a string) on this
        callable raises an exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to

        This decorator currently reduces to a noop, as the active Python
        interpreter is optimized (e.g., option ``-O`` was passed to this
        interpreter at execution time).
