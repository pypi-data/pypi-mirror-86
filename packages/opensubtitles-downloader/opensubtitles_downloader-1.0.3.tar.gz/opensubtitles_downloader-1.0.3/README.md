# TV Series Renamer
Simple script in python3 that download and organize subtitles from [OpenSubtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org).
The purpose of the program is to make easier for user to get every subtitle associated with its related video.

## How does it work
This program works in ~/Downloads (default) or in a directory passed as argument.

1. It takes every *subdirectory*, *video*, *archive* and *subtitle* file in folder that looks like it's a tv-series related file.
2. After that it move archives in the corrisponding folder or extracts their contents if the video file is in the same directory
of the archive.
3. If a video file and a subtitle file are related (same tv-shows name and same season and episode) the program renames the subtitle
the same as the video.

## Configure OpenSubtitle account
Configure **opensubtitles.json** file as show in **opensubtitles.json.example** and put it into **~/.opensubtitles_downloader**.
If you want to use it anonymously don't insert any username, otherwise use your account on [OpenSubtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org).

-- opensubtitles.json.example --
```json
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "language": ["en"],
    "useragent": "mistalbo"
}
```

## Install package from pip
```bash
pip install --user opensubtitles-downloader
```

## How to use it
#### Launch it with ~/Downloads directory as target:
```bash
$ opensubtitles_downloader
```

#### Launch it with user input directory as target:
```bash
$ opensubtitles_downloader -d <directory>
```

#### Launch it with user input file as target:
```bash
$ opensubtitles_downloader -f <filename>
```

#### Launch it with clean option:
```bash
$ opensubtitles_downloader -c
```
When this option is activated, the script looks for all subtitles for which there is no video file related and for all empty directories,
then it put them in trash.
Using the clean option doesn't prevent the program from downloading subtitles, it's intended as an extra action and not as an alternative to regular actions.
