        =================
        
        Simple script in python3 that download and organize subtitles from
        `OpenSubtitles <http://www.opensubtitles.org>`__. The purpose of the
        program is to make easier for user to get every subtitle associated with
        its related video.
        
        How does it work
        ----------------
        
        This program works in ~/Downloads (default) or in a directory passed as
        argument.
        
        1. It takes every *subdirectory*, *video*, *archive* and *subtitle* file
           in folder that looks like it’s a tv-series related file.
        2. After that it move archives in the corrisponding folder or extracts
           their contents if the video file is in the same directory of the
           archive.
        3. If a video file and a subtitle file are related (same tv-shows name
           and same season and episode) the program renames the subtitle the
           same as the video.
        
        Configure OpenSubtitle account
        ------------------------------
        
        Configure **opensubtitles.json** file as show in
        **opensubtitles.json.example** and put it into
        **~/.opensubtitles_downloader**. If you want to use it anonymously don’t
        insert any username, otherwise use your account on
        `OpenSubtitles <http://www.opensubtitles.org>`__.
        
        – opensubtitles.json.example –
        
        .. code:: json
        
           {
               "username": "username",
               "password": "password",
               "language": "eng",
               "useragent": "mistalbo"
           }
        
        Install package from pip
        ------------------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install --user opensubtitles-downloader
        
        How to use it
        -------------
        
        Launch it with ~/Downloads directory as target:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ opensubtitles_downloader
        
        Launch it with user input directory as target:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ opensubtitles_downloader -d <directory>
        
        Launch it with user input file as target:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ opensubtitles_downloader -f <filename>
        
        Launch it with clean option:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ opensubtitles_downloader -c
        
        When this option is activated, the script looks for all subtitles for
        which there is no video file related and for all empty directories, then
        it put them in trash. Using the clean option doesn’t prevent the program
        from downloading subtitles, it’s intended as an extra action and not as
        an alternative to regular actions.
