  Args:
    spots: A rank 1 real `Tensor` with spot prices.
    expiry_times: A `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots` representing
      expiry values of the options.
    strikes: A `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots` representing
      strike price of the options.
    volatility: A `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots` representing
      volatility values of the options.
    discount_factors: A `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots`
      representing discount factors at the expiry times.
    num_samples: Number of Monte Carlo samples.
    num_exercise_times: Number of excercise times for American options.
    basis_fn: Callable from a `Tensor` of the same shape
      `[num_samples, num_exercice_times, 1]` (corresponding to Monte Carlo
      samples) and a positive integer `Tenor` (representing a current
      time index) to a `Tensor` of shape `[basis_size, num_samples]` of the same
      dtype as `spots`. The result being the design matrix used in
      regression of the continuation value of options.
      This is the same argument as in `lsm_algorithm.least_square_mc`.
    seed: A tuple of 2 integers setting global and local seed of the Monte Carlo
      sampler
    is_call_option: A bool `Tensor`.
    num_calibration_samples: An optional integer less or equal to `num_samples`.
      The number of sampled trajectories used for the LSM regression step.
      Default value: `None`, which means that all samples are used for
        regression.
    dtype: `tf.Dtype` of the input and output real `Tensor`s.
      Default value: `None` which maps to `float64`.
    name: Python str. The name to give to the ops created by this class.
      Default value: `None` which maps to 'forward_rate_agreement'.
  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of the same shape and dtyoe as `spots` representing american
    option prices.
