Description: # libcodebusters
        
        `libcodebusters` is my attempt at programming a variety of cipher encode and decode methods!
        
        Here's what it can do:
        
        |Encrypt|Decrypt|
        |:--:|:--:|
        |Affine|Affine|
        |Aristocrat|Atbash|
        |Atbash|Caesar|
        |Baconian|Hill|
        |Caesar|Rail Fence|
        |Hill|Vigenere|
        |Patristocrat|
        |Rail Fence|
        |Vigenere|
        
        I used the `numpy` and `sympy` libraries to create `libcodebusters`.
        
        I'm always trying to add new features! If you have a cipher that you'd like to see me include, let me know and I'll give it a shot.
        In addition, I'm aware that these methods may not be very efficient - if you have an idea for improving the performance of this code, tell me about it.
