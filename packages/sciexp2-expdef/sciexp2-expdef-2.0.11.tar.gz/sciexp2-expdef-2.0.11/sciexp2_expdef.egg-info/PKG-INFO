Description: SciExp²-ExpDef (aka *Scientific Experiment Exploration - Experiment Definition*)
        provides a framework for defining experiments, creating all the files needed for
        them and, finally, executing the experiments.
        
        SciExp²-ExpDef puts a special emphasis in simplifying experiment design space
        exploration, using a declarative interface for defining permutations of the
        different parameters of your experiments, and templated files for the scripts
        and configuration files for your experiments. SciExp²-ExpDef supports various
        execution platforms like regular local scripts and cluster jobs. It takes care
        of tracking their correct execution, and allows selecting which experiments to
        run (e.g., those with specific parameter values, or those that were not
        successfully run yet).
