SciExp²-ExpDef
==============

SciExp²-ExpDef (aka *Scientific Experiment Exploration - Experiment Definition*)
provides a framework for defining experiments, creating all the files needed for
them and, finally, executing the experiments.

SciExp²-ExpDef puts a special emphasis in simplifying experiment design space
exploration, using a declarative interface for defining permutations of the
different parameters of your experiments, and templated files for the scripts
and configuration files for your experiments. SciExp²-ExpDef supports various
execution platforms like regular local scripts and cluster jobs. It takes care
of tracking their correct execution, and allows selecting which experiments to
run (e.g., those with specific parameter values, or those that were not
successfully run yet).
