# gpg python binding (incomplete functionality)

A python `gpg` module written from scratch.

## Installation

### From `PyPI`

It's simple. Just do:

```bash
[sudo] pip install [--user] gpg-lite
```

### From git

To install this package from this git repository, do:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/biomedit/gpg-lite.git
cd gpg-lite
./setup.py install [--user]
```

To get started using python-gnupg's API, see the documentation,
and import the module like:

```python
import gpg_lite
```

The primary interface class you'll likely want to interact with is `gpg_lite.GPGStore`

```python
gpg_store = gpg_lite.GPGStore(config_dir='/home/user/.gnupg')
gpg_store.gen_key(
    key_type='RSA',
    key_length=4096,
    full_name="Chuck Norris",
	email="chuck.norris@roundhouse.gov",
	passphrase="Chuck Norris does not need one - the password needs him")
keys = gpg_store.list_pub_keys()
print(keys)
```

**Note**: Make sure that the `/home/user/.gnupg` directory exists.
