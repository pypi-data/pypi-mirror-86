<p>MapIt is a service that maps postcodes and geographical points to
administrative areas. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone who has a postcode or
co-ordinates of a point in Italy, and needs to find out what municpality,
province, region, or electoral constituency it lies within.
It&rsquo;s also great for looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.</p>
