A fast numerical algorithm for inferring relative ability from multi-entrant contest winning probabilities. This 
repo includes code and draft paper accepted for publication into SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics.

### Usage

To use a default skew-normal performance distribution:

    from winning.skew_calibration import skew_dividend_implied_ability
    dividends = [2.0, 3.0, 6.0] 
    ability  = skew_dividend_implied_ability(dividends=dividends)
    prices   = skew_ability_implied_dividends(ability)

Alternatively see winning.lattice_calibration and use functions such as state_price_implied_ability(prices, density) which allow
you to specify whatever performance distribution you like. 

### Overview 

The lattice_calibration module allows the user to infer relative abilities from state prices in a multi-entrant contest. The assumption
made is that the performance distribution of one competitor is a translation of the performance distribution of another. 

At the racetrack, this would mean looking at the win odds and infering a relative ability of horses. The algorithm is:

- Fast 

- Scalable (to contests with hundreds of thousands of entrants)

- General (it works for any performance distribution). 


### Nomenclature 

The algorithm takes state prices as inputs. These are for practical purposes equivalent to winning probabiliites (as the lattice size grows and ties are less common).

- State prices. The expectation of an investment that has a payoff equal to 1 if there is only one winner, 1/2 if two are tied, 1/3 if three are tied and so forth. 

- Relative ability refers to how much one performance distribution needs to be 
translated in order to match another. 

- Implied abilities are vectors of relative abilities consistent with a collection of state prices.

- Dividends are the inverse of state prices.   


### Special cases

Two natural choices are:

- Standard normal, as per normal_calibration module. 

- Skew-normal, as per skew_calibration module.
