## The settings below define the way input data is handeled
# ScalarInput: 0 = input from mapstacks (.map); 1 = input from timeseries (.tss)
ScalarInput=1
# InputSeries can be used if multiple sets of input series are available, TE: maybe better to remove this option?
InputSeries=1
# InterpolationMethod: inv = inverse distance,  pol = Thiessen polygons, this option is not relevant if the number of cells is equal to the number of meteo gauges
InterpolationMethod=inv

##  Remaining model settings
# L_IR(UR(FR)) indicates with reservoirs are treated lumped with regard to moisture states. 0 = distributed; 1 = lumped. IR = interception reservoir; UR = unsaturated zone reservoir; FR = fast runoff reservoir
L_IRURFR = 0
L_URFR = 0
L_FR = 0
# maxTransitTime is the travel time (same time resolution as model calculations) through the stream of the most upstream point, rounded up
maxTransitTime = 9
# DistForcing is the number of used rainfall gauges
DistForcing = 3
# maxGaugeId is the id of the raingauge with the highest id-number, this setting has to do with writing the output data for the correct stations
maxGaugeId = 10
# timestepsecs is the number of seconds per time step
timestepsecs = 3600

## the settings below deal with the selection of classes and conceptualisations of reservoirs
## classes indicates the number of classes, the specific characters are not important (will be used for writing output??), but the number of sets of characters is important
classes = ['W','H']

## selection of reservoir configuration - 'None' means reservoir should not be modelled for this class
selectSi = interception_overflow2, interception_overflow2
selectSu= unsatZone_LP_beta, unsatZone_LP_beta
selectSus=None,None 
selectSf=fastRunoff_lag2, fastRunoff_lag2
selectSr=None,None

## selection of Ss (lumped over entire catchment, so only one!)
# selectSs = <some other reservoir than groundWaterCombined3>

## wflow maps with percentages, the numbers correspond to the indices of the characters in classes.
wflow_percent_0 = staticmaps/wflow_percentW4.map
