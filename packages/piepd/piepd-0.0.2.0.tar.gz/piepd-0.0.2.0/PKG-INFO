Description: # Summary
        
        This is a high level e-paper libaray. It supports QR code displays and allows easy lines of text writing along with right text align. Ideally if used this libaray should be imported to use the helpful class `EPD`.
        
        **Note** This works for all waveshare screens when you import it. Simply change the line from,
        
            from waveshare_epd import epd1in54_V2
        	
        To whatever screen you have. For instance the 5.83 inch BW screen
        
            from waveshare_epd import epd5in83
        	
        Or the color version (bc)
        
            from waveshare_epd import epd5in8bc
        	
        	
        # Installation
        
        Simply install this package from the pypi repo
        
            pip install piepd
        	
        # Command Line Interface
        
        There are a few example displays that can be run through the cli,	
        
        	epd occipied #Displays text saying the tools is occupied
        	epd --help #To see altenative displays
        
        # Implementation Example
        
        	from epd import EPD
        	epd = EPD()
        	epd.setFontSize(21)
        	epd.drawText("Hello world",draw=False) #Draws this text on the screen
        	epd.drawText("Left",draw=False) #Does not display yet until draw=True
        	
        	#The following line will right align the text and put it on the previous line
        	epd.drawText("Right",right=True,overlap=True,draw=True)
        	
        	#Once you are completly done using the dislplay run
        	epd.close()
