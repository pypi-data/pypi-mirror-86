Description: ######################################
        About the Neural Network MLPClassifier
        ######################################
        
        The *Neural Network MLPClassifier* software package is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package
        that provides a supervised classification method for multi-band passive optical remote sensing data.
        It uses an MLP (Multi-Layer Perception) Neural Network Classifier and is based on the Neural Network MLPClassifier
        by scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html.
        
        The program was originally developed by Lieven P.C. Verbeke (Ghent University, Laboratory of Forest Management and
        Spatial Information Techniques). It was written in C++ and ported to PyQGIS in 2019 - 2020. It has been developed in an
        open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.
