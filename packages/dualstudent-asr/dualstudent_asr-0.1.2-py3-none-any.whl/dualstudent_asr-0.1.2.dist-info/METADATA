# Dual Student for Automatic Speech Recognition
Dual Student is a semi-supervised learning algorithm originally introduced for image classification by Ke et al. In this work, we implement, validate and extend it for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). See the [report](https://github.com/franco-ruggeri/dt2119-dualstudent-asr/blob/master/docs/report.pdf) for more details. This project is part of the course DT2119 Speech and Speaker Recognition at KTH.
