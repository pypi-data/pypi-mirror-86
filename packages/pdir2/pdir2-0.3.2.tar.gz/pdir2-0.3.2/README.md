:warning: On master branch, pdir2's codebase is **Python 3.5+**, with annotations and mypy check. The Python 2 compatible version exists in the [0.3.x](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/tree/0.3.x) branch and will still be receiving bug fixes. All new features will be developed on master therefore is Python 3.5+ exclusive.

In short, if you're still using pdir2 for Python &lt;3.5, install via `pip install "pdir2>=0.3,<0.4"`.

Have you ever dreamed of a better output of `dir()`? I do. So I created this.

## Features

-   Attributes are grouped by types/functionalities, with beautiful colors.

-   Support color customization, [here's how](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/User-Configuration).

-   Support all platforms including Windows(Thanks to [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)).

-   Support [ipython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython), [ptpython](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython), [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)! See [wiki](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/REPL-Support) for details.

-   The return value of `pdir()` can still be used as a list of names.

-   âœ¨ Attribute searching

    You can search for certain names with `.s()` or `.search()`:  

    ![](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/raw/master/images/search.gif)

    Search is case-insensitive by default.  
     `search(name, case_sensitive=True)` does case sensitive searching.

-   :star2: Attribute filtering

    `properties`: Find properties/variables defined in the inspected object.

    `methods`: Find methods/functions defined in the inspected object.

    `public`: Find public attributes.

    `own`: Find attributes that are not inherited from parent classes.

    These filters **can be chained!** Order does **NOT** matter.

    For example, use `pdir(obj).public.own.methods` to find all public own methods.

    You can also call `search` on the returned results.

    See a [complete example](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/Attribute-Filtering).

## Install

### Generic

    pip install pdir2

About the name. I wanted to call it "pdir", but there's already one with this
name on pypi. Mine is better, of course.

### Fedora

    dnf install python3-pdir2
    --or--
    dnf install python2-pdir2

## Automatic Import

As a better alternative of `dir()`, it's more convenient to automatically import
pdir2 when launching REPL. Luckily, Python provides a way to do this. In you `.bashrc`(or `.zshrc`), add this line:

    export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonstartup

Then, create `.pythonstartup` in your home folder. Add one line:

    import pdir

Next time you launch REPL, `pdir()` is already there, Hooray!

## Testing

Simply run `pytest`, or use `tox` if you like.

## Developement

Clone the source, run `make install_dev_packages`.   
Don't forget to add proper type annotations,
if you're not sure what to do, check out the `gen_type_info` section in `tox.ini`.
