    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`funpack` performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Import\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All data files are loaded in, unwanted columns and subjects are dropped, and\n",
    "the data files are merged into a single table (a.k.a. data frame). Multiple\n",
    "files can be merged according to an index column (e.g. subject ID). Or, if the\n",
    "input files contain the same columns/subjects, they can be naively\n",
    "concatenated along rows or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cleaning steps are applied to each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NA value replacement:** Specific values for some columns are replaced\n",
    "   with NA, for example, variables where a value of `-1` indicates *Do not\n",
    "   know*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable-specific cleaning functions:** Certain columns are\n",
    "   re-formatted; for example, the [ICD10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10)\n",
    "   disease codes can be converted to integer representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Categorical recoding:** Certain categorical columns are re-coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Child value replacement:** NA values within some columns which are\n",
    "   dependent upon other columns may have values inserted based on the values\n",
    "   of their parent columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During the processing stage, columns may be removed, merged, or expanded into\n",
    "additional columns. For example, a categorical column may be expanded into a set\n",
    "of binary columns, one for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A column may also be removed on the basis of being too sparse, or being\n",
    "redundant with respect to another column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Export\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed data can be saved as a `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.hdf5` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout these examples, we are going to use a few command line\n",
    "options, which you will probably **not** normally want to use:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `-ow` (short for `--overwrite`): This tells `funpack` not to complain if\n",
    "   the output file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    " - `-q` (short for `--quiet`): This tells `funpack` to be quiet.  Without the\n",
    "   `-q` option, `funpack` can be quite verbose, which can be annoying, but is\n",
    "   very useful when things go wrong. A good strategy is to tell `funpack` to\n",
    "   produce verbose output using the `--noisy` (`-n` for short) option, and to\n",
    "   send all of its output to a log file with the `--log_file` (or `-lf`)\n",
    "   option.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   > ```\n",
    "   > funpack -n -n -n -lf log.txt out.tsv in.tsv\n",
    "   > ```\n",
