        # Firefly III Command Line Interface
        
        A python-based command line interface for practically entering expenses in [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org).
        
        *This project was inspired on [firefly-bot](https://github.com/vjFaLk/firefly-bot), a Telegram bot to create transactions in Firefly III. Some of the API code and examples were forked from this project.*
        
        # Instalation
        This CLI tool is available on PyPI. So the easiest way to install is:
        ```shell
        # Install firefly-cli from PyPI
        pip install firefly-cli
        
        # Enjoy! Runs firefly-cli
        firefly-cli
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the library module as a script:
        ```shell
        # Clone the repository
        git clone https://github.com/afonsoc12/firefly-cli.git
        
        # Go to root directory
        cd firefly-cli
        
        # Install dependencies
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        # Run module as a script
        python -m firefly_cli
        ```
        
        # Usage
        The CLI has two modes of operation:
          - In one-line command style:
            
        ```shell
        $ firefly-cli add 5.2, Large Mocha, Cash, Starbucks
        ```
          
          - Command Line Interface:
          
        ```bash
        $ firefly-cli

        ===== Status =====
          - URL: https://firefly.mydomain.com
          - API Token: *****xYcV
          - Connection: OK!
        
        Type "help" to list commands.
        
        üê∑ ‚ûú
        ```
        
        # Setup
        If you run firefly-cli, you will see that you do not have connection.
        In order to configure your Firefly III `URL` and `API_TOKEN` you have to run these two commands:
        
        ```shell
        # Start CLI, well this one does not count as a command üôÉ
        firefly-cli
        
        # Set your Firefly URL, such as https://firefly.mydomain.com
        edit URL <YOUR URL>
        
        # Set your Firefly API_TOKEN
        edit API_TOKEN <YOUR API TOKEN>
        ```
        
        After entering these values, firefly-cli will automatically refresh API connection. At any point you can refresh API connection by yourself:
        ```shell
        # Refreshes API connection
        refresh
        ```
        
        # Commands
        The scope of this CLI is to enter expenses in a comma-separated style. Therefore, some commands do not have a "very polished" UI for the moment. I am looking forward to improve this soon!
        
        If you find any bugs (which you WILL!), please submit a new issue or PR! I am more than happy to accept new suggestions, improvements and corrections.
