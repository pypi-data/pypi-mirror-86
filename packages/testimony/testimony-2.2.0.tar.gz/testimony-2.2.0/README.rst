Testimony
=========

Are you tired of managing your test cases in a test case management tool and
your test code in a python automation framework?  Testimony can help to use
the python automation framework as a test case repository tool.

The project testimony is written to inspect and report on the python test
cases.  There are several reporting features in this program.

The `full documentation <http://testimony-qe.readthedocs.io/>`_ is available on
ReadTheDocs.
