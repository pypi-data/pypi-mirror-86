Description: # `bandlab-master`
        
        `bandlab-master` is a Python script that uploads a song to your [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/) account, masters it with default settings, and downloads it as WAV.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * `chromium`
        * `chromedriver`
        * `selenium` (a `pip` package)
        * `webdriver-extended` (a `pip` package)
        * `zmtools` (a `pip` package)
        
        **Note:** It is unknown how well this works if installed via the DEB file due to dependencies. I think you may need to use the non-snap version of Chromium. This will be addressed in the future.
        
        ## Usage
        
        `bandlab-master [file_to_master]`
        
        Make sure your BandLab credentials are in `~/.bandlab/.creds`, username on first line and password on second.
