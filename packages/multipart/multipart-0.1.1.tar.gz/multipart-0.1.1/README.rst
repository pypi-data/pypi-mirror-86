Parser for multipart/form-data
==============================

This module provides a parser for the multipart/form-data format. It can read
from a file, a socket or a WSGI environment. The parser can be used to replace
cgi.FieldStorage (without the bugs) and works with Python 2.5+ and 3.x (2to3).

Features
--------

* Python 2.5+ and 3.x (2to3) support. No dependencies.
* Parses multipart/form-data and application/x-url-encoded.
* Produces useful error messages in 'strict'-mode.
* Uploads of unknown size (missing Content-Length header).
* Fast memory mapped files (io.BytesIO) for small uploads.
* Temporary files on disk for big uploads.
* Memory and disk resource limits to prevent DOS attacks.
* 100% test coverage.

Compared to cgi.FieldStorage()
------------------------------

* Reads directly from a socket (no ``.readline(n)``, just ``.read(n)``).
* Consumes bytes regardless of Python version.
* Is desgined for WSGI, not CGI.
* Is not broken.


Todo
----

* Support for base64 and quoted-printable transfer encoding.
