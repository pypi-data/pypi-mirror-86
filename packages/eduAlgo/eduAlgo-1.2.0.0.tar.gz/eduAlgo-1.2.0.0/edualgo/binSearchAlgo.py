        FIND AN ELEMENT FROM A GIVEN SORTED LIST USING BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM AND PRINT THE ELEMENT'S POSITION
        -+-+-+-
        In binary search we take a sorted list of elements and start looking for an element at the middle of the list.
        If the search value matches with the middle value in the list we complete the search.
        Otherwise we eleminate half of the list of elements by choosing whether to procees with the right or left half
        of the list depending on the value of the item searched. This is possible as the list is sorted and it is
        much quicker than linear search. Here we divide the given list and conquer by choosing the proper half of the
        list. We repeat this approcah till we find the element or conclude about it's absence in the list.
        -+-+-+-
        PSEUDOCODE:
            1. Compare 'x' with the middle element
            2. If x matches with the middle most element, we return the index of the middle element i.e. 'mid'.
            3. Else if x is greater than the middle element, x will lie in the right sub-part of the list from the middle element.Thus, we recur the right part of the list.
            4. Else, the x is smaller than the middle element, so we recur the left sub-part of the list.

        TIME COMPLEXITY OF BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM:

            Worst-case performance: O(log n)
            Best-case performance: O(1)
            Average performance: O(log n)
            Worst-case space complexity: O(1)
