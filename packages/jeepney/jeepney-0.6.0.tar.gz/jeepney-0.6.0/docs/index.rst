Jeepney |version|
=================

Jeepney is a pure Python interface to D-Bus, a protocol for interprocess
communication on desktop Linux (mostly).

The core of Jeepney is `I/O free <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/>`__, and the
``jeepney.io`` package contains bindings for different event loops to
handle I/O. Jeepney tries to be *non-magical*, so you may have to write a bit
more code than with other interfaces such as `dbus-python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbus-python>`_
or `pydbus <https://github.com/LEW21/pydbus>`_.

Jeepney doesn't rely on libdbus or other compiled libraries, so it's easy
to install with Python tools like ``pip``. To use it, the DBus daemon needs to
be running on your computer; this is a standard part of most modern Linux
desktops.
