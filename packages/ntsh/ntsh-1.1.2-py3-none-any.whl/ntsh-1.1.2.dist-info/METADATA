ntsh is an interactive tool for line-based protocols, such as HTTP
or SMTP. It can be thought of as a netcat that's better suited to
interactive use by a human. Features include an editable prompt,
history, and syntax highlighting, and asynchronous replies from
the server won't interfere with the prompt.
