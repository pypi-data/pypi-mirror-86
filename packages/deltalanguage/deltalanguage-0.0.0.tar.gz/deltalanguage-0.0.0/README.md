Deltalangauage allows the programmer to define a graph of all the compute elements and declare the transport of data between them. Depending on which type of hardware a part of the program is running on, the nodes of this graph get filled with python (for the CPU) or migen (for the FPGAs). A hardware abstraction layer is built into the language, that standardises which operations can be triggered on qubits. This makes Deltaflow.OSÂ® portable across technologies.
