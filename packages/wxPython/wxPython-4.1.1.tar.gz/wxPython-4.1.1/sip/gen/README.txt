This directory is where wxPython's ETG scripts will deposit the
wrapper generator files which describe the wxWidgets APIs that
wxPython wraps. These files will be fed to SIP to produce the C++ code
for the extension modules.

Currently these files are not committed to the source repository, (GitHub)
but they should be included in any source tarballs that are distributed.
