:class:`ScrolledThumbnail` is a widget that can be used to display a series of
thumbnails for files in a scrollable window.

Description
===========

:class:`ScrolledThumbnail` is a widget derived from :class:`wx.ScrolledWindow`
which will display the thumbnail image for a file in a scrollable, resizable
window.  It supports selecting one or more thumbnails, rotating the thumbnails,
displaying information for each thumbnail, and popups for both the window and
for individual thumbnails.

The class uses two support classes: :class:`Thumb` and :class:`ImageHandler`.

:class:`Thumb` contains all of the information for a particular thumbnail,
including filename, bitmaped thumbnail image, caption, and other data.  This
class also has methods to perform thumbnail operations such as rotation,
highlighting, setting a file name.

:class:`ImageHandler` provides file/image handling functions, including loading
a file and creating an image from it, rotating an image, or highlighting an image.

The implementations of these two classes included in this file support generating
thumbnails from supported image files, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc., using either
WxPythons native support or the PIL image library.  Additional file types can be
supported by extending these classes, for example, to provide a thumbnail image
for an MP4 file, perhaps the cover photo, an MPEG by providing the image of a
title frame, or a PDF by providing an image of the cover page.  The images for
these files may be generated on the fly by a suitably extended :class:`ImageHandler`,
or may be provided with the instance of :class:`Thumb`.  The list of `Thumb`
instances passed to `ScrolledThumbnail` may contain different derived classes,
as long as each contains the required funtions.

NB:  Use of :class:`ScrolledThumbnail` has not been tested with extended classes.

:class:`ScrolledThumbnail`, :class:`Thumb`, and :class:`ImageHandler`, implemented
here are derived from the similarly named classes included in :class:`agw.ThumbnailCtrl`,
written by Andrea Gavana.  That implementation was tightly integrated as a image
file browser application.  The current implementation removes dependencies between
the several classes and narrows the scope of `ScrolledThumbnail` to the placement
and management of thumbnails within a window.

An updated :class:`ThumbnailCtrl` which uses this implementation of
:class:`ScrolledThumbnail`, :class:`Thumb`, and :class:`ImageHandler` provides
all of the previous functionality, which described as a widget that can be used
to display a series of images in a "thumbnail" format; it mimics, for example,
the windows explorer behavior when you select the "view thumbnails" option.
Basically, by specifying a folder that contains some image files, the files
in the folder are displayed as miniature versions of the actual images in
a :class:`ScrolledWindow`.

The code in the previous implementation is partly based on `wxVillaLib`, a
wxWidgets implementation of the :class:`ThumbnailCtrl` control.  Andrea Gavana
notes that :class:`ThumbnailCtrl` wouldn't have been so fast and complete
without the suggestions and hints from Peter Damoc.

Usage:
=====

Usage example::

    import os
    import wx
    from scrolledthumbnail import ScrolledThumbnail, Thumb, NativeImageHandler

    class MyFrame(wx.Frame):

        def __init__(self, parent):
            wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, -1, "ScrolledThumb Demo", size=(400,300))

            self.scroll = ScrolledThumbnail(self, -1, size=(400,300))

        def ShowDir(self, dir):
            dir = os.getcwd()
            files = os.listdir(dir)
            thumbs = []
            for f in files:
                if os.path.splitext(f)[1] in [".jpg", ".gif", ".png"]:
                    thumbs.append(Thumb(dir, f, caption=f, imagehandler=NativeImageHandler))
            self.scroll.ShowThumbs(thumbs)


    app = wx.App(False)
    frame = MyFrame(None)
    frame.ShowDir(os.getcwd())
    frame.Show(True)

    app.MainLoop()



Methods and Settings
====================

With :class:`ScrolledThumbnail` you can:

- Create different thumbnail outlines (none, images only, full, etc...);
- Highlight thumbnails on mouse hovering;
- Show/hide file names below thumbnails;
- Change thumbnail caption font;
- Zoom in/out thumbnails (done via ``Ctrl`` key + mouse wheel or with ``+`` and ``-`` chars,
  with zoom factor value customizable);
- Rotate thumbnails with these specifications:

  a) ``d`` key rotates 90 degrees clockwise;
  b) ``s`` key rotates 90 degrees counter-clockwise;
  c) ``a`` key rotates 180 degrees.

- Drag and drop thumbnails from :class:`ScrolledThumbnail` to whatever application you want;
- Use local (when at least one thumbnail is selected) or global (no need for
  thumbnail selection) popup menus;
- possibility to show tooltips on thumbnails, which display file information
  (like file name, size, last modification date and thumbnail size).

:note: Using highlight thumbnails on mouse hovering may be slow on slower
 computers.
