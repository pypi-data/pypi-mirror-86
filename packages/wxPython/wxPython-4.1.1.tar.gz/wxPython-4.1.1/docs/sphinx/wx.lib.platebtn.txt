Editra Control Library: PlateButton

The PlateButton is a custom owner drawn flat button, that in many ways emulates
the buttons found the bookmark bar of the Safari browser. It can be used as a
drop in replacement for wx.Button/wx.BitmapButton under most circumstances. It
also offers a wide range of options for customizing its appearance, a
description of each of the main style settings is listed below.

Main Button Styles:
Any combination of the following values may be passed to the constructor's style
keyword parameter.

PB_STYLE_DEFAULT:
Creates a flat label button with rounded corners, the highlight for mouse over
and press states is based off of the hightlight color from the systems current
theme.

PB_STYLE_GRADIENT:
The highlight and press states are drawn with gradient using the current
highlight color.

PB_STYLE_SQUARE:
Instead of the default rounded shape use a rectangular shaped button with
square edges.

PB_STYLE_NOBG:
This style only has an effect on Windows but does not cause harm to use on the
platforms. It should only be used when the control is shown on a panel or other
window that has a non solid color for a background. i.e a gradient or image is
painted on the background of the parent window. If used on a background with
a solid color it may cause the control to loose its transparent appearance.

PB_STYLE_DROPARROW:
Add a drop button arrow to the button that will send a separate event when
clicked on.

Other attributes can be configured after the control has been created. The
settings that are currently available are as follows:

  - SetBitmap: Change/Add the bitmap at any time and the control will resize and
               refresh to display it.
  - SetLabelColor: Explicitly set text colors
  - SetMenu: Set the button to have a popupmenu. When a menu is set a small drop
             arrow will be drawn on the button that can then be clicked to show
             a menu.
  - SetPressColor: Use a custom highlight color


Overridden Methods Inherited from PyControl:

  - SetFont: Changing the font is one way to set the size of the button, by
             default the control will inherit its font from its parent.

  - SetWindowVariant: Setting the window variant will cause the control to
                      resize to the corresponding variant size. However if the
                      button is using a bitmap the bitmap will remain unchanged
                      and only the font will be adjusted.

Requirements:
  - python2.4 or higher
  - wxPython2.8 or higher
