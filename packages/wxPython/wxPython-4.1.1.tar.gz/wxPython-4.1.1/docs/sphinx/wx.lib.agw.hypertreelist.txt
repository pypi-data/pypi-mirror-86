|phoenix_title|  **wx.lib.agw.hypertreelist**
==========================================================================================================================================

:class:`~wx.lib.agw.hypertreelist.HyperTreeList` is a class that combines the
multicolumn features of a :class:`wx.ListCtrl` in report mode with the
hierarchical features of a :class:`wx.TreeCtrl`. Although it looks more like a
:class:`wx.ListCtrl`, the API tends to follow the API of :class:`wx.TreeCtrl`.


Description
===========

:class:`HyperTreeList` was originally inspired from the
``wx.gizmos.TreeListCtrl`` class from Classic wxPython. Now in Phoenix the old
wrapped C++ ``wxTreeListCtrl`` class is gone and this class can be used in its
place. In addition to the features of the old ``wx.gizmos.TreeListCtrl`` this
class supports:

* CheckBox-type items: checkboxes are easy to handle, just selected or unselected
  state with no particular issues in handling the item's children;
* Added support for 3-state value checkbox items;
* RadioButton-type items: since I elected to put radiobuttons in
  :class:`~wx.lib.agw.customtreectrl.CustomTreeCtrl`, I needed some way to handle
  them that made sense. So, I used the following approach:

  - All peer-nodes that are radiobuttons will be mutually exclusive. In other words,
    only one of a set of radiobuttons that share a common parent can be checked at
    once. If a radiobutton node becomes checked, then all of its peer radiobuttons
    must be unchecked.
  - If a radiobutton node becomes unchecked, then all of its child nodes will become
    inactive.

* Hyperlink-type items: they look like an hyperlink, with the proper mouse cursor on
  hovering;
* Multiline text items;
* Enabling/disabling items (together with their plain or grayed out icons);
* Whatever non-toplevel widget can be attached next to a tree item;
* Whatever non-toplevel widget can be attached next to a list item;
* Column headers are fully customizable in terms of icons, colour, font, alignment etc...;
* Default selection style, gradient (horizontal/vertical) selection style and Windows
  Vista selection style;
* Customized drag and drop images built on the fly;
* Setting the :class:`HyperTreeList` item buttons to a personalized imagelist;
* Setting the :class:`HyperTreeList` check/radio item icons to a personalized imagelist;
* Changing the style of the lines that connect the items (in terms of :class:`wx.Pen` styles);
* Using an image as a :class:`HyperTreeList` background (currently only in "tile" mode);
* Ellipsization of long items when the horizontal space is low, via the ``TR_ELLIPSIZE_LONG_ITEMS``
  style (`New in version 0.9.3`).

And a lot more. Check the demo for an almost complete review of the functionalities.


Base Functionalities
====================

:class:`HyperTreeList` supports all the :class:`wx.TreeCtrl` styles, except:

- ``TR_EXTENDED``: supports for this style is on the todo list (Am I sure of this?).

Plus it has 3 more styles to handle checkbox-type items:

- ``TR_AUTO_CHECK_CHILD``: automatically checks/unchecks the item children;
- ``TR_AUTO_CHECK_PARENT``: automatically checks/unchecks the item parent;
- ``TR_AUTO_TOGGLE_CHILD``: automatically toggles the item children.

And a style useful to hide the TreeListCtrl header:

- ``TR_NO_HEADER``: hides the :class:`HyperTreeList` header.

And a style related to long items (with a lot of text in them), which can be
ellipsized:

- ``TR_ELLIPSIZE_LONG_ITEMS``: ellipsizes long items when the horizontal space for
  :class:`HyperTreeList` is low (`New in version 0.9.3`).


Please note that most TreeCtrl-like APIs are available in this class, although
they may not be visible to IDEs or other tools as they are automatically
delegated to the :class:`CustomTreeCtrl` or other helper classes.


Usage
=====

Usage example::

    import wx
    import wx.lib.agw.hypertreelist as HTL

    class MyFrame(wx.Frame):

        def __init__(self, parent):

            wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, -1, "HyperTreeList Demo")

            tree_list = HTL.HyperTreeList(self)

            tree_list.AddColumn("First column")

            root = tree_list.AddRoot("Root")

            parent = tree_list.AppendItem(root, "First child")
            child = tree_list.AppendItem(parent, "First Grandchild")

            tree_list.AppendItem(root, "Second child")


    # our normal wxApp-derived class, as usual

    app = wx.App(0)

    frame = MyFrame(None)
    app.SetTopWindow(frame)
    frame.Show()

    app.MainLoop()



Events
======

All the events supported by :class:`wx.TreeCtrl` and some from :class:`wx.ListCtrl` are
also available in :class:`HyperTreeList`, with a few exceptions:

- ``EVT_TREE_GET_INFO`` (don't know what this means);
- ``EVT_TREE_SET_INFO`` (don't know what this means);
- ``EVT_TREE_ITEM_MIDDLE_CLICK`` (not implemented, but easy to add);
- ``EVT_TREE_STATE_IMAGE_CLICK`` (no need for that, look at the checking events below).

Plus, :class:`HyperTreeList` supports the events related to the checkbutton-type items:

- ``EVT_TREE_ITEM_CHECKING``: an item is being checked;
- ``EVT_TREE_ITEM_CHECKED``: an item has been checked.

And to hyperlink-type items:

- ``EVT_TREE_ITEM_HYPERLINK``: an hyperlink item has been clicked (this event is sent
  after the ``EVT_TREE_SEL_CHANGED`` event).


Supported Platforms
===================

:class:`HyperTreeList` has been tested on the following platforms:
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * Mac


Window Styles
=============

This class supports the following window styles:

============================== =========== ==================================================
Window Styles                  Hex Value   Description
============================== =========== ==================================================
``TR_NO_BUTTONS``                      0x0 For convenience to document that no buttons are to be drawn.
``TR_SINGLE``                          0x0 For convenience to document that only one item may be selected at a time. Selecting another item causes the current selection, if any, to be deselected. This is the default.
``TR_HAS_BUTTONS``                     0x1 Use this style to show + and - buttons to the left of parent items.
``TR_NO_LINES``                        0x4 Use this style to hide vertical level connectors.
``TR_LINES_AT_ROOT``                   0x8 Use this style to show lines between root nodes. Only applicable if ``TR_HIDE_ROOT`` is set and ``TR_NO_LINES`` is not set.
``TR_DEFAULT_STYLE``                   0x9 The set of flags that are closest to the defaults for the native control for a particular toolkit.
``TR_TWIST_BUTTONS``                  0x10 Use old Mac-twist style buttons.
``TR_MULTIPLE``                       0x20 Use this style to allow a range of items to be selected. If a second range is selected, the current range, if any, is deselected.
``TR_EXTENDED``                       0x40 Use this style to allow disjoint items to be selected. (Only partially implemented; may not work in all cases).
``TR_HAS_VARIABLE_ROW_HEIGHT``        0x80 Use this style to cause row heights to be just big enough to fit the content. If not set, all rows use the largest row height. The default is that this flag is unset.
``TR_EDIT_LABELS``                   0x200 Use this style if you wish the user to be able to edit labels in the tree control.
``TR_ROW_LINES``                     0x400 Use this style to draw a contrasting border between displayed rows.
``TR_HIDE_ROOT``                     0x800 Use this style to suppress the display of the root node, effectively causing the first-level nodes to appear as a series of root nodes.
``TR_COLUMN_LINES``                 0x1000 Use this style to draw a contrasting border between displayed columns.
``TR_FULL_ROW_HIGHLIGHT``           0x2000 Use this style to have the background colour and the selection highlight extend  over the entire horizontal row of the tree control window.
``TR_AUTO_CHECK_CHILD``             0x4000 Only meaningful for checkbox-type items: when a parent item is checked/unchecked its children are checked/unchecked as well.
``TR_AUTO_TOGGLE_CHILD``            0x8000 Only meaningful for checkbox-type items: when a parent item is checked/unchecked its children are toggled accordingly.
``TR_AUTO_CHECK_PARENT``           0x10000 Only meaningful for checkbox-type items: when a child item is checked/unchecked its parent item is checked/unchecked as well.
``TR_ALIGN_WINDOWS``               0x20000 Flag used to align windows (in items with windows) at the same horizontal position.
``TR_NO_HEADER``                   0x40000 Use this style to hide the columns header.
``TR_ELLIPSIZE_LONG_ITEMS``        0x80000 Flag used to ellipsize long items when the horizontal space for :class:`HyperTreeList` columns is low.
``TR_VIRTUAL``                    0x100000 :class:`HyperTreeList` will have virtual behaviour.
