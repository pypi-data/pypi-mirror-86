   .. method:: DrawGalleryBackground(self, dc, wnd, rect)

      Draw the background and chrome for a :ref:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery`  control.                  

      This should draw the border, background, scroll buttons, extension button, and any other UI elements which are not attached to a specific gallery item. 




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto, which is always the gallery whose background and chrome is being drawn. Attributes used during drawing like the gallery hover state and individual button states can be queried from this parameter by :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.IsHovered` , :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetExtensionButtonState` , :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetUpButtonState` , and :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetDownButtonState` .   
      :type `wnd`: wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery
      :param `rect`: The rectangle within which to draw. This rectangle is the entire area of the gallery control, not just the client rectangle.

   .. method:: DrawGalleryItemBackground(self, dc, wnd, rect, item)

      Draw the background of a single item in a :ref:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery`  control.                  

      This is painted on top of a gallery background, and behind the items bitmap. Unlike :meth:`DrawButtonBarButton`   and :meth:`DrawTool` , it is not expected to draw the item bitmap - that is done by the gallery control itself. 




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto, which is always the gallery which contains the item being drawn.   
      :type `wnd`: wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery
      :param `rect`: The rectangle within which to draw. The size of this rectangle will be the size of the item's bitmap, expanded by gallery item padding values (wx``wx.ribbon.RIBBON_ART_GALLERY_BITMAP_PADDING_LEFT_SIZE``, ``wx.ribbon.RIBBON_ART_GALLERY_BITMAP_PADDING_RIGHT_SIZE``, ``wx.ribbon.RIBBON_ART_GALLERY_BITMAP_PADDING_TOP_SIZE``, and ``wx.ribbon.RIBBON_ART_GALLERY_BITMAP_PADDING_BOTTOM_SIZE``). The drawing rectangle will be entirely within a rectangle on the same device context previously painted with :meth:`DrawGalleryBackground` .   
      :type `rect`: wx.Rect
      :param `item`: The item whose background is being painted. Typically the background will vary if the item is hovered, active, or selected; :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetSelection` , :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetActiveItem` , and :meth:`wx.ribbon.RibbonGallery.GetHoveredItem`   can be called to test if the given item is in one of these states.   
      :type `item`: RibbonGalleryItem










                  





   .. method:: DrawHelpButton(self, dc, wnd, rect)

      Draw help button on :ref:`wx.ribbon.RibbonBar`.                  

      This should draw a help button at top right corner of ribbon bar. 




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto, which is always the panel whose background and chrome is being drawn. The panel label and other panel attributes can be obtained by querying this.   
      :type `wnd`: wx.ribbon.RibbonBar
      :param `rect`: The rectangle within which to draw.  
      :type `rect`: wx.Rect

   .. method:: DrawMinimisedPanel(self, dc, wnd, rect, bitmap)

      Draw a minimised ribbon panel.                  




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto, which is always the panel which is minimised. The panel label can be obtained from this window. The minimised icon obtained from querying the window may not be the size requested by :meth:`GetMinimisedPanelMinimumSize`   - the  `bitmap`  argument contains the icon in the requested size.   
      :type `wnd`: wx.ribbon.RibbonPanel
      :param `rect`: The rectangle within which to draw. The size of the rectangle will be at least the size returned by :meth:`GetMinimisedPanelMinimumSize` .   
      :type `rect`: wx.Rect
      :param `bitmap`: A copy of the panel's minimised bitmap rescaled to the size returned by :meth:`GetMinimisedPanelMinimumSize` .   
      :type `bitmap`: wx.Bitmap










                  





   .. method:: DrawPageBackground(self, dc, wnd, rect)

      :type `rect`: wx.Rect








                  



      .. seealso:: :meth:`GetPageBackgroundRedrawArea`     








   .. method:: DrawPanelBackground(self, dc, wnd, rect)

      Draw the background and chrome for a ribbon panel.                  

      This should draw the border, background, label, and any other items of a panel which are outside the client area of a panel. 

      Note that when a panel is minimised, this function is not called - only :meth:`DrawMinimisedPanel`   is called, so a background should be explicitly painted by that if required. 




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto, which is always the panel whose background and chrome is being drawn. The panel label and other panel attributes can be obtained by querying this.

      :param `rect`: The rectangle within which to draw. The size of this rectangle will be at least the size returned by :meth:`GetScrollButtonMinimumSize`   for a scroll button with the same style. For tab scroll buttons, this rectangle will be entirely within a rectangle on the same device context previously painted with :meth:`DrawTabCtrlBackground` , but this is not guaranteed for other types of button (for example, page scroll buttons will not be painted on an area previously painted with :meth:`DrawPageBackground` ).   
      :type `rect`: wx.Rect
      :param `style`: A combination of flags from :ref:`wx.ribbon.RibbonScrollButtonStyle`, including a direction, a for flag, and one or more states.   
      :type `style`: long










                  





   .. method:: DrawTab(self, dc, wnd, tab)

      Draw a single tab in the tab region of a ribbon bar.                  




      :param `dc`: The device context to draw onto.   
      :type `dc`: wx.DC
      :param `wnd`: The window which is being drawn onto (not the :ref:`wx.ribbon.RibbonPage`  associated with the tab being drawn).   
      :type `wnd`: wx.Window
      :param `tab`: The rectangle within which to draw, and also the tab label, icon, and state (active and/or hovered). The drawing rectangle will be entirely within a rectangle on the same device context previously painted with :meth:`DrawTabCtrlBackground` .

   .. method:: GetColourScheme(self)

      Get the current colour scheme.                  

      Returns three colours such that if :meth:`SetColourScheme`   were called with them, the colour scheme would be restored to what it was when :meth:`SetColourScheme`   was last called. In practice, this usually means that the returned values are the three colours given in the last call to :meth:`SetColourScheme` , however if :meth:`SetColourScheme`   performs an idempotent operation upon the colours it is given (like clamping a component of the colour), then the returned values may not be the three colours given in the last call to :meth:`SetColourScheme` . If :meth:`SetColourScheme`   has not been called, then the returned values should result in a colour scheme similar to, if not identical to, the default colours of the art provider. Note that if :meth:`SetColour`   is called, then :meth:`GetColourScheme`   does not try and return a colour scheme similar to colours being used - it's return values are dependent upon the last values given to :meth:`SetColourScheme` , as described above. 









      :rtype: `tuple`
