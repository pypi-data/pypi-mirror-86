Description: # pyocd_remote
        
        Remote execution wrapper for [PyOCD](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD).
        
        This tool runs `pyocd` on a remote SSH server and does additional copying / tunneling, so it looks like `pyocd` is running locally.
        Usage:
        ```
        pyocd_remote user@host:port [--cmd pyocd_executable] [pyocd_args ...]
        ```
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        For this tool to work, the local SSH client needs to be authorized at the remote server using a public key, and the remote server needs to be in the list of known hosts.
        
        ## Examples
        
        ```
        pyocd_remote user@host:port erase --chip
        ```
        Erases the chip connected to the remote host.
        
        ```
        pyocd_remote user@host:port flash image.bin
        ```
        Copies `image.bin` to the remote host, then flashes it there.
        
        ```
        pyocd_remote user@host:port gdbserver --port 50000
        ```
        Starts a gdbserver on the remote host and creates a tunnel, so it looks like a local gdbserver to the debugger.
