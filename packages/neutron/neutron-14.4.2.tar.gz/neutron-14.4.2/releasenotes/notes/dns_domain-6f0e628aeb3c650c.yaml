    Previously a network's ``dns_domain`` attribute was ignored by the DHCP
    agent.  With this release, OpenStack deployments using Neutron's DHCP agent
    will be able to specify a per network ``dns_domain`` and have instances
    configure that domain in their dns resolver configuration files (Linux's
    /etc/resolv.conf) to allow for local partial DNS lookups. The per-network
    ``dns_domain`` value will override the DHCP agent's default ``dns_domain``
    configuration value. Note that it's also possible to update a network's
    ``dns_domain``, and that new value will be propogated to new instances
    or when instances renew their DHCP lease. However, existing leases will
    live on with the old ``dns_domain`` value.
