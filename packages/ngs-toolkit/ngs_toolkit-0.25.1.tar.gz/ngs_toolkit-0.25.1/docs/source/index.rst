``ngs_toolkit`` is a Python library for the analysis of NGS data.

Its goals are to provide a highly customizable set of objects and tools that
interact with each other to create data processing and analysis workflows in
both a interactive and scripted way.

``ngs-toolkit`` is unique in the following aspects:

 - Includes tried-and-tested (and published) workflows for end-to-end analysis of NGS data, while at the same time allowing high customization;
 - Tailored for well-established NGS data types, but supporting arbitrary data types;
 - Its target audience are mid-level computational biologists who want to "get it done" and focus on interpretation of results. At the same time, it allows running workflows with minimal programming experience.

``ngs-toolkit`` is reaching maturity, with a stable API (from version 0.14.0 on),
improving documentation and increasing test coverage.
