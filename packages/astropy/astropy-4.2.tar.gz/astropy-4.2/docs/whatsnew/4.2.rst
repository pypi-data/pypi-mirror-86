.. _whatsnew-4.2-cosmology:

Planck 2018 is accepted and now the default cosmology
=====================================================

The accepted version of the Planck 2018 cosmological parameters has been included
and has become the default cosmology.  It is identical to the previous, preliminary
version (Planck18_arXiv_v2), which is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck18
  >>> Planck18.age(0)

.. _whatsnew-4.2-time-perf-imp:

Time performance improvements
=============================

The performance for creating a ``Time`` object from a large array of
fixed-format string times was dramatically improved. For ISO and ISOT formats
the speed-up is a factor of 25 and for the year day-of-year format the speedup
is a factor of 50. This is done with a new C-based time string parser which can
also be used for custom user-defined Time formats. For details see
:ref:`time-fast-c-parser`.

In addition the performance for creating a scalar ``Time`` object in a epoch
format like ``unix``, ``unix_tai``, or ``cxcsec`` was improved by a factor of 4.


.. _whatsnew-4.2-erfa:

Removed ERFA module
===================

The private ``_erfa`` module has been converted to its own package `PyeERFA
<https://pyerfa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. It is now a required
dependency of astropy, and can be directly imported with ``import
erfa``. Importing ``_erfa`` from ``astropy`` now issues a deprecation
warning and will be removed in the future.
