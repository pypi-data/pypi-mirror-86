Description: 
        Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl, partly based on youtube-dl-gui
        and written in Python 3 / Gtk 3.
        
        - You can download individual videos, and even whole channels and
        playlists, from YouTube and hundreds of other websites
        - You can fetch information about those videos, channels and playlists,
        without actually downloading anything
        - Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders
        - If creators upload their videos to more than one website (YouTube and
        BitChute, for example), you can download videos from both sites without
        creating duplicates
        - Certain popular websites manipulate search results, repeatedly
        unsubscribe people from their favourite channels and/or deliberately
        conceal videos that they don't like. Tartube won't do any of those things
        - Tartube can, in some circumstances, see videos that are region-blocked
        and/or age-restricted
        
        Note for PyPI users: Tartube should be installed with: pip3 install tartube
