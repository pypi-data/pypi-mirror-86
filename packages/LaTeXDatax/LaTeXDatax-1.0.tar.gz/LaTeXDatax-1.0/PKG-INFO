Description: # LaTeXDatax.py
        Import calculated values from a python script into a LaTeX document.
        This is a python interface for [the datax LaTeX package [ctan]](https://ctan.org/pkg/datax).
        
        ## Installation
        One method that works, though it may not be *the way* in python, is downloading the repo, and running `pip install .` in the root directory of it.
        
        ## Usage
        In a python script:
        ```python
        from LaTeXDatax import datax
        datax(
        		filename = "data.tex",
        		a = "Literal string",
        		b = 3.141592,
        		c = (3.141592,"\\meter"),
        		d = (3.141592,"\\meter","%.2g"),
        		e = (3.141592,"%.2g"),
             )
        ```
        
        In the LaTeX document:
        ```tex
        \documentclass{article}
        \usepackage{siunitx}
        \usepackage{datax}
        \begin{document}
        	The length was measured as \(d=\datax{d}\).
        \end{document}
        ```
        
        ## Looking for contributors
        I don't know python very well. This should be a working package, but it would probably be better in more comfortable hands.
        Specifically, I'm not sure how to distribute packages in the python ecosystem.
