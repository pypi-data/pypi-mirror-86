Stay-Awake is a Simple Platform Independent Python package to keep your system awake without affecting workflow!

* Does this affect workflow? 
> No, this only get's triggered when you don't do any mouse movements!

* Is there a GUI?
> This was intended to be a light weight solution, so as of now it only has a CLI!

* How does it work?
> If in a span of 60 seconds you don't move your mouse, this script will automatically move your mouse for about 1 to 4 pixels randomly. There won't be any mouse displacement! If you are working, this will do absolutely nothing!
