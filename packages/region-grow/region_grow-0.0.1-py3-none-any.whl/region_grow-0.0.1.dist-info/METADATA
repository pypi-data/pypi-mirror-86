# region_grow
Create a polygon using a set of points from a region of interest by grouping pixels whose spectral reflectance is similar. The polygons are created using a satellite image in GeoTIFF format. In this project several algorithms are implemented to build this figure. Among them are: Selection by similarity threshold (%), Euclidean distance and selection by confidence interval. The generated polygon is exported in ESRI Shapefile format
