        Design Choice
        -------------
        This method has a very general implementation, considering all the custom functions, which can be passed in
        as arguments to customize behaviour. This makes this function server as a basis for all the more specialized
        functions, which this class offers. As every specific behaviour only presents some sort of specialization of
        the generic behaviour for this class. But is also serves the user; in case some special functionality is
        needed and not yet offered by other functions of this class, this method can be used.
        Although using it for everything is discouraged, as simple plots are not as straight forward as they could be.

        :param routes:                  A list of list of ints. Each sub list within this list represents a separate
                                        route. Each integer within this route is the ID of a node, which is visited as
                                        part of the route. The order of the integers in the list is the order of
                                        visits.
        :param coordinates:             A list of tuples of two numeric values. The tuples represent the coordinates of
                                        the nodes within a route. Each index in this list represents the integer ID
                                        of the node
        :param axes:                    Optionally an Axes object can be passed in. In this case the plot is drawn

                                        current node.
        :param get_node_alpha:          Function, which accepts the parameters route index, current node ID, ID of the
                                        next node in the route. Returns a float value between 0 and 1, which defines
                                        the alpha channel(opacity) for the display of the current node
        :param get_label:               Optional Function, which accepts the parameters route index, current node ID,
                                        ID of the next node in the route. Returns a string, which will be displayed

        So what is the purpose of this function? The general problem with creating Gantt chart style plots for the
        visualization of timing/schedules is that they are organized in fixed rows on the y-axis usually. Creating
        these discrete rows from continuous coordinates is a task which all the of the schedule plots will have in
        column. So this function provides a means of simplifying the overhead for keeping track of the vertical row
        position.
