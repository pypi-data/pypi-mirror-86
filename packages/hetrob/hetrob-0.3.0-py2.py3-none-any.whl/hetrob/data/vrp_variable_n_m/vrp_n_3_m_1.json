All tasks are indepedendent.\n- Random node distribution: Node locations will be completely\n- 2D Coordinates: Everything will be on the same z coordinate\n\nThe following instance attributes can be set for the generation process:\n- Depot Coordinates\n- Vehicle speed\n- Range for the generation of random task coordinates\n- Range for the generation of task durations\n- The amount of nodes to be generated\n- The amount of vehicles available\n(- Location to save data)\n",
