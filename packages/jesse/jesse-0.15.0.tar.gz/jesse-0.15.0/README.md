Jesse is an advanced crypto trading framework which aims to simplify researching and defining trading strategies.

## Why Jesse?
In short, Jesse is more accurate than other solutions, and way more simple. 
In fact, it is so simple that in case you already know Python, you can get started today, in matter of minutes, instead of weeks and months. 

[Here](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/) you can read more about why Jesse's features. 

## Getting Started
Head over to the "getting started" section of the [documentation](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/getting-started). The 
documentation is short yet very informative. 

## Example Backtest Results

Check out Jesse's [blog](https://jesse.trade/blog) for tutorials that go through example strategies step by step. 

Here's an example output for a backtest simulation just to get you excited:

## How to contribute
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. Before starting to work on a PR, please make sure that it isn't under the "in progress" column in our [Github project page](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse/projects/2). In case you want to help but don't know what tasks we need help for, checkout the "todo" column. 

First, you need to install Jesse from the repository instead of PyPi:

```sh
# first, make sure that the PyPi version is not installed
pip uninstall jesse

# now install Jesse from the repository
git clone https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse.git
cd jesse
pip install -e .
```

Now every change you make to the code will be affected immediately.

After every change, make sure your changes did not break any functionality by running tests:
```
pytest
```
