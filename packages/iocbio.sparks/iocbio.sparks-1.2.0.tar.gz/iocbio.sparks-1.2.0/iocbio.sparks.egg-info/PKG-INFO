Description: # Semi-automatic calcium sparks detection software
        
        IOCBIO Sparks is a cross-platform application for analysis and
        detection of calcium sparks when imaged using confocal microscope line
        scanning mode. 
        
        IOCBIO Sparks is a free software released under the GNU General Public
        License (GPL), see the file [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) for details. 
        
        For testing the software, we have uploaded example datasets at
        https://sysbio.ioc.ee/software/iocbio-sparks .
        
        Results of the analysis are stored in the database (schema described
        in [docs/database-schema](docs/database-schema) and, if needed, can be
        exported into spreadsheet file.
        
        ## Citations and software description
        
        Software is described in a paper published in PeerJ (see below) that
        gives a background information regarding use of the software and shows
        an example analysis of sparks. Please cite this paper if you use the
        software.

        ## Installation
        
        There are several ways to install the software. The application
        requires python3.
        
        For Linux, at present, installation using `pip` is recommended. It is
        expected that `pip` soulution would work for Mac as well. 
        
        For Windows, `conda` solution is recommended for users that don't have
        Python installed already. Otherwise, if using other than Anaconda
        Python, consider using `pip` solution.
        
        ### pip
        
        To be able to install PyQt5 using pip, you have to use python3.5 or
        higher. If not available in the system, you can replace `pip3` command
        below with `python3 -m pip`.
        
        To install published version, run
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user iocbio.sparks
        ```
        This will install all dependencies and it is expected to add a command `iocbio-sparks` into your `PATH`. 
        If the command is missing after installation, check whether the default location
        of `pip3` installation is in your path. For Linux, it should be `~/.local/bin`.
        
        Its possible to install from Git repository directly:
        ```
        pip3 install --user git+https://gitlab.com/iocbio/sparks
        ```
        
        For development, use
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user -e .
        ```
        
        in the source directory. To install the current version from the source, use
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user .
        ```
        
        Note that `--user` is recommended to avoid messing up the system
        packages.
        
        
        ### conda (Anaconda or Miniconda3)
        
        Here, concise installation instructions are given. For illustrated
        instructions with screenshots, see [Detailed Anaconda
        instructions](docs/INSTALL.Anaconda.md)
        
        #### Installation Anaconda
        
        Install Anaconda Python environment by downloading it from
        https://www.anaconda.com/ . The package uses Python 3 language, so,
        the version supporting it should be installed. At the moment of
        writing, its Python 3.6.
        
        #### Installation of iocbio.sparks
        
        For installation from GUI:
        * Start Anaconda Navigator
        * Add channels by clicking "Channels" on the main screen and adding: 
            * conda-forge
            * iocbio
        * icon for `iocbio.sparks` application should appear on the main
          Anaconda Navigator. Click on its install for installation.
          
        Please note, it may take several minutes to install the application due 
        to its dependencies. 
        
        For installation from CLI, start Anaconda Prompt. In the prompt, add channels:
        ```
        conda config --append channels conda-forge
        conda config --append channels iocbio
        ```
        and install software
        ```
        conda install -c iocbio iocbio-sparks
        ```
        and you are all set.
        
        For running iocbio.sparks in Windows, its possible to start it as an
        application from Anaconda Navigator or, directly, from starting
        `iocbio-sparks` in `Anaconda/Scripts` directory. For convinience, a
        shortcut can be created on desktop or Start Menu by the user.
