        # Python APIs
        This is a set of examples in Python showing how to use our APIs. It covers all that we offer.
        
        Before you start, the most important step is to ensure that you have an account. This is where most people get into issues. Contrary to most websites, you create your account using the API themselves. So all you need to open your account are these APIs, themselves. Just head straight to *TQ_example_account_create_account.py* to open your new account.
        
        ## 1. Open Your New Account
        Once you opened your account you would have ample free credit in your account to get up the curve. Free top-ups will continue periodically to ensure those with small and moderate use will be able to use our services for free.
         
        
          
        ## 2. Getting around the python files
