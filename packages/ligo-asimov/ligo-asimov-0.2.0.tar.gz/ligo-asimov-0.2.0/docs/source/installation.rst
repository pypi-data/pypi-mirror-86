Installing Asimov
=================

The preferred method for installing `Asimov` is to use `pip`, and install in a virtual environment.::
   
   pip install ligo-asimov

You can also install `Asimov` directly from its source, either by cloning its repository and running::
  
   pip install .

In the root of the repository, or alternatively directly from the master branch on the LIGO gitlab server by running::
  
   pip install git+https://git.ligo.org/daniel-williams/supervisor.git

You should use the package with care if installing from source; while the master branch should represent stable code, it may contain new or undocumented features, or behave unexpectedly.
