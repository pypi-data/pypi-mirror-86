             'hi send by a bot')  # message

<!-- ----
**Advise**: If you are thinking about making high-quality smooth automations switch to Telegram. WhatsApp is the worst messenger available to humanity. WhatsApp does not provide any Official free API. And to operate with WhatsApp Web you need your phone to be connected to the internet. And the QR code login mechanism makes it even slower. On the other hand, Telegram is cloud-based, and simply just better.

I literally hate WhatsApp. Its my frustration with WhatsApp that forces me to write this message. Switch to Telegram, Enjoy a better life. Checkout my [Telegram Bots](https://github.com/aahnik/lovely-telegram#lovely-telegram).

- **[Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**
- [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

Make sure to have matching versions of the Chrome Browser and Chrome Driver.
I recommend using the latest stable release for both to get the best performance.

WappDriver does not support other Browsers. Please use Chrome for a smooth experience
