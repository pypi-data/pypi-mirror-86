Description: # spacy-annotator
        spaCy annotator for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using ipywidgets.
        The annotator allows users to quickly assign custom labels to one or more entities in the text.   
        
        **Features**:
        * The annotator supports pandas dataframe (see `pandas_annotations.py`): it adds annotations in a separate 'annotation' column of the dataframe;
        * If a spacy model is passed into the annotator, the model is used to identify entities in text.   
        This trick of pre-labelling the example using the current best model available allows for accelerated labelling - also known as of noisy pre-labelling;
        * The annotations adhere to spaCy format and are ready to serve as input to spaCy NER model.   
        No additional code required!
        
        **Note**: not using pandas dataframe? No problem. You can always label entities from text stored in a simple python list (see `list_annotations.py`).

        ## Example code - pandas annotations
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import re
        from spacy_annotator.pandas_annotations import annotate as pd_annotate
        
        # Data
        df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({'full_text' : ['New York is lovely but Milan is amazing!']})
        
        # Annotations
        pd_dd = pd_annotate(df,
                    col_text = 'full_text',     # Column in pandas dataframe containing text to be labelled
                    labels = ['GPE', 'PERSON'], # List of labels
                    sample_size=1,              # Size of the sample to be labelled
                    delimiter='~',              # Delimiter to separate entities in GUI
                    model = None,               # spaCy model for noisy pre-labelling
                    regex_flags=re.IGNORECASE   # One (or more) regex flags to be applied when searching for entities in text
                    )
        
        # Example output
        pd_dd['annotations'][0]
        ```
