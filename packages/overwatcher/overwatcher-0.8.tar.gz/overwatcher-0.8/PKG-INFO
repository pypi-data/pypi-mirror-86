Description: # Overwatcher
        A simple app for sending telegram notification on completion of a long-running command.
        ## Setting up
        Install package:
        ```shell script
        pip install overwatcher
        ```
        Setup environment variables (at least two required):
        ```shell script
        export OVERWATCHER_TOKEN=...
        export OVERWATCHER_CHAT=...
        ```
        The former should contain token of a telegram bot which could be obtained from `@BotFather`, the latter can be requested from `@chatid_echo_bot`. 
        Other env variables are not necessary:
        ```shell script
        export OVERWATCHER_BASE_FILE_PATH=... # base filepath from which to start searching mentioned files (default value is /home)
        export OVERWATCHER_N_FILES=... # the number of last files from the log to push (default value is 3)
        export OVERWATCHER_N_LINES=... # the number of lines from command output to forward (default value is 20)
        export OVERWATCHER_MAX_LINE_LENGTH=... # max number of characters on a single line (default value is 100)
        ```
        ## Usage
        Example:
        ```shell script
        python -m overwatcher notify "ls -alh && sleep 10"
        ```
        Response is sent to a telegram chat:
        ```shell script
        Command echo nice is completed in 0.003 seconds. Result:
        nice
        ```
