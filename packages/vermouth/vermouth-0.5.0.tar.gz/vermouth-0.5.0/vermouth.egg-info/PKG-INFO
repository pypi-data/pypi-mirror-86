        Martinize2 is a rewrite of [Martinize]. It is aimed at producing
        coarse-grained structures and topologies from an atomistic structure. Martinize
        is primarily developed for the [Martini] coarse-grained force field and the
        [Gromacs] simulation engine. However the architecture of the program will
        allow us to support a broader range of force fields and simulation engines in
        the future.
        
        Vermouth (for VERsatile, MOdular,  and Universal Tranformation Helper) is the
        python library that powers Martinize2. It allows to describe and apply
        transformation on molecular structures and topologies using graph algorithms.
        
        ## Disclaimer
        
        Martinize2 and Vermouth are under development. Bugs can occur. If you encounter an issue, please report it on
        <https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize/issues>. Carefully check your input and output files before
        using them; read the messages displayed by the program.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Martinize2 and vermouth require python 3.6 or greater. They are distributed via [PyPi][pypi_vermouth], and can be
        installed using the `pip` command:
            
            pip install vermouth
        
        This installs the last released version. You can update an existing installation by running `pip install -U vermouth`.
        In some cases you may want to experiment with running the latest development version. You can install this version with
        the following command: 
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize.git#vermouth
        
        Note that vermouth and Martinize2, in particular development versions, may contain bugs that cause it to produce
        incorrect topologies. Check the produced output carefully!
        
        The behavior of the `pip` command can vary depending of the specificity of your
        python installation. See the [documentation on installing a python
        package][pipdoc] to learn more.
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        Installing Martinize2 and vermouth with `pip` adds the `martinize2` program to
        the research PATH. You can see the available option of the program by running:
        
            martinize2 -h
        
        At the moment, martinize2 tries to reproduce the interface of the original
        Martinize. You can find explanations on how to use Martinize on the [Martini
        tutorials]; in most cases, replacing calls to `martinize.py` by calls to
        `martinize2` should produce similar results.
        
        The documentation of the vermouth python library will come soon.
