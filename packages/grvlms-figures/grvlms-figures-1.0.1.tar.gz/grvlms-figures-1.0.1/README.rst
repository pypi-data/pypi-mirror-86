Figures plugin for `Grvlms`
============================================================

`Figures <https://github.com/appsembler/figures>`_ is a data retrieval and reporting app for Open edX; this is a plugin for Grvlms that allows quick and easy integration in an Open edX platform. It works both locally and on a Kubernetes-based platform.


Installation
------------

This plugin requires grvlms>=1.0.4. Also, you should have installed grvlms from source, and not from a pre-compiled binary.

::
  
    pip install grvlms-figures

Then, to enable this plugin, run::
  
    grvlms plugins enable figures

You will have to re-generate the environment and rebuild the "openedx" docker image::
  
    grvlms config save
    grvlms images build openedx

You will then have to run LMS migrations. To do so, run::
  
    grvlms local init

This last step is unnecessary if you run instead ``grvlms local quickstart``.

You should then be able to access the Figures dashboard at ``http://<your lms host>/figures``. On a local instance, you should be able to access it at http://localhost/figures.
