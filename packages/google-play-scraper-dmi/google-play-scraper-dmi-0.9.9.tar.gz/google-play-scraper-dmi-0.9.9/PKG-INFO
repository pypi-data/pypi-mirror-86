Description: # Google Play Store Scraper
        This defines a lightweight Python class that can be used to scrape app 
        information from the Google Play Store. It defines a couple of methods that can
        be used to get relevant app IDs given a set of parameters, and a couple of 
        methods to then scrape data about these app IDs.
        
        Much of this has been adapted from 
        [google-play-scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/google-play-scraper), a 
        nodeJS-based scraper that does similar things. But this scraper uses Python.
        
        ## Getting started
        The following scrapes app details about all apps similar to the first result 
        for the 'fortnite' search query:
        
        ```
        from google_play_scraper.scraper import PlayStoreScraper
        
        scraper = PlayStoreScraper()
        results = scraper.get_app_ids_for_query("fortnite")
        similar = scraper.get_similar_app_ids_for_app(results[0])
        
        app_details = scraper.get_multiple_app_details(similar)
        print(list(app_details))
        ```
        
        Documentation is not available separately yet, but the code is relatively
        simple and you can look in the `scraper.py` file to see what methods are 
        available and what their parameters are.
