Description: # kepi
        
        kepi is a Django-based microblogging system, implemented in Python.
        It uses the ActivityPub protocol to communicate with other servers,
        and the Mastodon protocol to communicate with clients.
        
        There is nothing particularly interesting at [kepi.org.uk](https://kepi.org.uk),
        but there will be.
