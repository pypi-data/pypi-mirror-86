        # asn1editor
        Python based ASN.1 editor
        
        This project contains a generic editor to view ASN.1 encoded data. 
        It can load and save data encoded in various ASN.1 formats. 
        
        The controller part of the editor is written independently from the 
        used GUI framework. A view implementation with wxPython is provided and
        can be started by running wxEditor.
        
        ## Plugin interface
        
        In order to use custom data formats or to work with the data, plugins
        can be used. These plugins need to inherit from the Plugin.Plugin class and
        can use the PluginInterface.PluginInterface class to interact with the
        main application.
