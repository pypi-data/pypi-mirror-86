        Welcome to EzPyZ! This project seeks to provide an easy-to-use statistical library for Python 3. This project was inspired in concept by the [ez](https://github.com/mike-lawrence/ez) library available in R.  
        
        **This project is under development, and will likely not work as intended. You have been warned.**

        This package is installed using pip. Pip should come pre-installed with all versions of Python for which this package is compatible. Nonetheless, if you wish to install pip, you can do so by downloading [get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and running that python file (Windows/MacOS/Linux/BSD), or you can run the following command in terminal (Linux/BSD):
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install python3-pip
        ```
        
        If you're using brew (most likely for MacOS), you can install pip (along with the rest of Python 3) using brew:
        
        ```bash
        brew install python3
        ```
        
        **Note: The creator of this software does not recommend the installation of python or pip using brew, and instead recommends that pip be installed using [get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), or that Python 3.7+ be installed using the installation candidates found on [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which include pip by default.**
        
        ### Using Pip to install from PyPi
        
        Fetching this repository from PyPi is the recommended way to install this package. From your terminal, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install EzPyZ
        ```
        
        And that's it! Now you can go right ahead to the quick-start guide!
        
        ### Install from Source
        
        Not a big fan of pip? Well, you're weird, but weird is OK! I've written a separate script to help make installation from source as easy as possible. To start, download the installation script and run it:
        
        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGuthrieWasTaken/EzPyZ/main/source_install.py
        python3 source_install.py
        ```
        
        After completing, the script will have downloaded the latest tarball release and extracted it into the working directory. Now, all you have to do is switch into the newly-extracted directory and run the install command:
        
        ```bash
        cd EGuthrieWasTaken-EzPyZ-[commit_id]/
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        Congratulations, you just installed EzPyZ from source! Feel free to check out the quick-start guide!
        
        ## Quick-Start Guide
        
        Now that you have the package installed, getting started with the package should be easy! You can start with importing the package and creating a ``DataFrame``:
        
        ```python
        import EzPyZ as ez
        
        # Create new dataframe.
        raw_data = {
            'height (cm)': [134, 168, 149, 201, 177],
            'weight (kg)': [32.2, 64.3, 59.9, 95.4, 104.2]
        }
        df = ez.DataFrame(data=raw_data)
        ```
        
        Already have a ``pandas.DataFrame`` object? Great! You can create an ``EzPyZ.DataFrame`` object with an existing ``pandas.DataFrame``:
        
        ```python
        import EzPyZ as ez
        import pandas as pd
        
        # Create new dataframe.
        raw_data = {
            'height (cm)': [134, 168, 149, 201, 177],
            'weight (kg)': [32.2, 64.3, 59.9, 95.4, 104.2]
        }
        pandas_df = pd.DataFrame(raw_data)
        df = ez.DataFrame(data=pandas_df)
        ```
        
        Of course, most of the time you will not be hard-coding your data directly. Fortunately this package comes with tools to help with that as well! Check it out:
        
        ```python
        import EzPyZ as ez
        from EzPyZ.tools import read_file
        
        df = ez.DataFrame(data=read_file("bmi_data.csv")) # A bmi_data.xlsx would also work here.
        ```
        
        That should be enough to get you off the ground! To learn more, check out the documentation.
