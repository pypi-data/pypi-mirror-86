[![Build Status][travis-image]](https://travis-ci.org/keis/matchmock)
[![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]](https://coveralls.io/r/keis/matchmock?branch=master)

[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) matchers for
[mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) objects.

## Example

```
    f = Mock()
    f.method('foo', 'bar')

    assert_that(f.method, called_once_with(anything(), 'bar')
```

## Matchers

* `called` - match mock that was called one or more times
* `not_called` - match mock that was never called
* `called_once` - match mock that was called once regardless of arguments
* `called_with` - match mock has at least one call with the specified arguments
* `called_once_with` - match mock that was called once and with the specified arguments
* `called_n_times` - match mock that was called number of times.
