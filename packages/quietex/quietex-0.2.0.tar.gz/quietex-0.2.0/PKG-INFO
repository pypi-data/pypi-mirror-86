        QuieTeX is a minimal command-line tool which filters and colourizes the output of `pdflatex` in real-time.
        
        It is not a build tool, it does not do any clever summaries, it just makes it easier to read.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        ## Features
        
        * Hides open/close file logging
        
        * Colours errors red
        
        * Colours warnings yellow
        
        * TeX input prompt works in `errorstopmode` and `scrollmode`
        
        * `latexmk` integration
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        To install:
        
        ```bash
        
        pip3 install quietex
        
        ```
        
        
        
        To use:
        
        ```bash
        
        quietex pdflatex test.tex
        
        ```
        
        
        
        To use with `latexmk`, add this to your `latexmkrc`:
        
        ```perl
        
        # Make output prettier
        
        eval `quietex --latexmkrc`;
        
        ```
