# Cryptocurrency Historical Data Downloader
A desktop application to download historical data of desired crypto assets by connecting several different crypto-exchanges' API.

Historical data of crypto assets are demanded for different purposes such as investment analysis, academic research, etc. Though the data is most of the time publicly available, it is not always easy to reach it for the people who have less coding skills to connect API of crypto exchanges and download data by making several sequencing requests. Besides, crypto-exchanges mostly have different data formats that must be standardized. This application handles all these processes and makes it easier for its users.
