# recode

Converts ICD-10 codes to CDC/NCHS Selected Causes of Death codes. 

* ICD-10 stands for International Classification of Diseases v.10.
* CDC stands for Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention.
* NCHS stands for National Center for Health Statistics.

The folder "tables" has the text files that specify the grouping classification for each ICD-10 code. These files have been downloaded from [here](https://www.resdac.org/search-data-variables?name=icd-10%20cause%20of%20death).
They had a few errors (for example, some "1" were mistakenly typed as the letter "l") which were fixed here.

test_recoder.py, in folder "tests", provides an example on how this code can be used.

Requires Python 3.8+.
