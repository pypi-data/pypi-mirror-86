Description: # Headers as Dependencies
        
        HaD reads the `#include`d headers from a bunch of C files and prints the corresponding compiler options.
        For instance, if `#include <math.h>` is used, option `-lm` is required, or if `#include <pthread.h>` is used, `-pthread` is required.
        
        To do so, HaD relies on a database maintained by hand, as well as on `pkg-config`.
        It currently supports only GCC and Clang on Linux.
        
        ## Contributions welcome!
        
        You can help a lot by enriching files `hadlib/*.cfg`.
        This is actually the heart of the tool.
        All the rest is simple code to read and present this knowledge.
