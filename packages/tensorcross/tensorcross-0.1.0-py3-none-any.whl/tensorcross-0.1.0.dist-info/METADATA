        # TensorCross
        
        Cross Validation, Grid Search and Random Search for tf.data.Datasets in
        TensorFlow 2.3 and Python 3.8.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Currently, there is the tf.keras.wrapper.KerasClassifier/KerasRegressor class,
        which can be used to transform your tf.keras model into a sklearn estimator.
        However, this approach is only applicable if your dataset is a numpy.ndarray
        for your x and y data.
        If you want to use the new tf.data.Dataset class, you cannot use the sklearn
        wrappers.
        
        ## Implemented Features
        
        - Random Search (with one validation set)
        - Grid Search (with one validation set)
        
        ### TODO
        
        - Random search with cross validation
        - Grid search with cross validation
