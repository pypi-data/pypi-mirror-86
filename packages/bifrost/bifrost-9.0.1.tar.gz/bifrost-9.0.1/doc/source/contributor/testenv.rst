===================
Testing Environment
===================

Execute local testing
=====================

A simple ``scripts/test-bifrost.sh`` script can be utilized to install
pre-requisite software packages, Ansible, and then execute the
``test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` and ``test-bifrost.yaml`` playbooks in order
to provide a single step testing mechanism.

``playbooks/test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` creates one or more VMs for
testing and saves out a baremetal.json file which is used by
``playbooks/test-bifrost.yaml`` to execute the remaining roles.  Two
additional roles are invoked by this playbook which enables Ansible to
connect to the new nodes by adding them to the inventory, and then
logging into the remote machine via the user's ssh host key.  Once
that has successfully occurred, additional roles will unprovision the
host(s) and delete them from ironic.

Command::

  scripts/test-bifrost.sh

Note:

- In order to cap requirements for installation, an ``upper_constraints_file``
  setting is defined. This is consuming the ``UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE`` env
  var by default, to properly integrate with CI systems, and will default
  to ``/opt/stack/requirements/upper-constraints.txt`` file if not present.

Manually test with Virtual Machines
===================================

Bifrost supports using virtual machines to emulate the hardware.

The VirtualBMC_ project is used as an IPMI proxy, so that the same ``ipmi``
hardware type can be used as for real hardware.

#. Set ``testing`` to *true* in the
   ``playbooks/inventory/group_vars/target`` file.
#. You may need to adjust the value for ``ssh_public_key_path``.
#. Execute the ``ansible-playbook -vvvv -i inventory/target
   test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` command to create a test virtual
   machine.
#. Run the install step, as documented in :doc:`/install/index`, however
   adding ``-e testing=true`` to the Ansible command line.
#. Set the environment variable of ``BIFROST_INVENTORY_SOURCE`` to the
   path to the JSON file, which by default has been written to
   ``/tmp/baremetal.json``.
#. Run the :ref:`enrollment step <enroll>`, using the JSON file you created
   in the previous step.
#. Run the deployment step, as documented in :ref:`deploy`.
