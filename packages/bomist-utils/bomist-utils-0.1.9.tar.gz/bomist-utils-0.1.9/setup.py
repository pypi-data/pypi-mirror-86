A `.ws` file must exist in it.\n\nA `legacy.bomist_dump` file will be created on `outpath` or in the folder the command was called from if the `--out` option is not used. This file can then be imported by BOMIST v2.\n\n#### **Limitations**\n\nAt the moment this utility can only convert and keep data connections between:\n\n```\nparts, documents, labels, storage, categories\n```\n\nProjects, orders and history won't be converted.\n\nTo import projects into the new version you can export your BOMs into CSV files in the legacy version (right-click > Export) and then import them in the new version. Parts will be accordingly assigned to BOM designators, as long as those parts exists in the workspace.\n\nNeed help?
