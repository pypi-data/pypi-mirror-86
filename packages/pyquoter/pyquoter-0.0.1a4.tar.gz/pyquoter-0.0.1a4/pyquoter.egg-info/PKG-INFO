Description: # pyquoter
        A CLI tool to save your favorite quotes :).
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install pyquoter
        ```
        
        ## Usage 
        All of the flags and options are visible with the `--help` flag
        
        ### Creating quotes
        ```bash
        pyquoter -q "This is the quote!" -a "Author Name!" -d 11/20/2020 -t These are Tags
        
        pyquoter -q "This Another quote" -d 11/20/2020 -t cool inspirational # Author defaults to Unkown
        
        pyquoter -q "Just testing stuff" # All that is required is the quote
        ```
        
        ### Searching quotes
        To turn a quote insertion into a query just add the -f flag
        ```bash
        pyquoter -f -q "quote" # Outputs quotes that contain the word "quote"
        
        pyquoter -f -a "Abraham" # Outputs quotes with any author the word "Abraham" in their name
        
        pyquoter -f -i 1 # Outputs the quote with an ID of 1
        
        pyquoter -f -t inspirational # Outputs any quote tagged with the world inspirational
        ```
        
        ### Deleting quotes
        If you have a quote that you think isn't up to par, you can delete it by referencing its ID
        ```bash
        pyquoter --delete 1 # Deletes the quote with an ID of 1
        ```
        
        
        ## Creating an Alias
        Typing pyquoter may be a bit verbose so if you have a .bashrc add the line
        ```alias pq=pyquoter```
