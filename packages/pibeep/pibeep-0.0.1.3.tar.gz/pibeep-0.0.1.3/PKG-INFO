        # Summary
        
        This is a beeping utility for the common buzzer. This package comes with a variety of beeps that can be called from a command line inteface or imported from python.
        
        # Installation
        
        This package requires `RPi.GPIO`, which I installed on arch arm using
        
            yay -S python-raspberry-gpio
        	
        But ubuntu or rasbian can use,
        
            pip install RPi.GPIO
        
        To install pibeep simply install the pip package.
        
            pip install pibeep
        	
        You can then look at the examples on how to run as a cli. You can also import it into your project using,
        
        	from pibeep import pulseBeep,beepDuration
        	beepDuration(pin=12,duration=.33) #beeper on pin 12, on for .33 sec
        	pulseBeep(pin=12,freq=25,duration=1) #pulse beep at 25HZ for 1 seccond
        
        
        # Beeps
        
         - short: duration 0.05 sec
         - medium: duration 0.25 sec
         - long: duration 1.00 sec
         - warning: pulses 8HZ for 1.5 sec duration
         - confirmed: pulses 16HZ for .5 sec duration
         - brr: pulses 50HZ for .5 sec duration
         
        # Example
        
        The cli can be use any of the listed above beeps in the format as the following commands:
        
            beep warning --pin 12 #Warning sound
            beep short --pin 12 #Small beep
        	beep brr --pin 12 #A rumbling sound
        	beep confirmed --pin 12 #A sound that conveys success
        
        Usually I need to run it as sudo to have the correct permissions, but it depends on your setup.
