# Documentation

There is full documentation for this project hosted [here](https://crozzers.github.io/screen_brightness_control) but here are the basics

### ScreenBrightnessError(`Exception`) 
A generic error class designed to make catching errors under one umbrella easy. Raised when the brightness cannot be set/retrieved.

**Usage:**  
```python
import screen_brightness_control as sbc

try:
    sbc.set_brightness(50)
except sbc.ScreenBrightnessError as error:
    print(error)
```

### get_brightness(`verbose_error=False, **kwargs`)
**Summary:**  
Returns the current screen brightness as a percentage by default. If you're on Windows it may return a list of values if you have multiple, brightness adjustable monitors.  
Raises `ScreenBrightnessError` upon failure

**Arguments:**

* `verbose_error` - a boolean value to control how much detail any error messages should contain
* `kwargs` - passed to the OS relevant brightness method

**Usage:**  
```python
import screen_brightness_control as sbc

#get the current screen brightness (for all detected displays)
all_screens_brightness = sbc.get_brightness()
#get the brightness of the primary display
primary_display_brightness = sbc.get_brightness(display=0)
#get the brightness of the secondary display (if connected)
secondary_display_brightness = sbc.get_brightness(display=1)
```  


### set_brightness(`value, force=False, verbose_error=False, **kwargs`)
**Summary:**  
Sets the brightness to `value`. If `value` is a string and contains "+" or "-" then that value is added to/subtracted from the current brightness.
Raises `ScreenBrightnessError` upon failure

**Arguments:**

* `value` - the level to set the brightness to. Can either be an integer or a string.
* `force` (Linux only) - if set to `False` then the brightness is never set to less than 1 because on Linux this often turns the screen off. If set to `True` then it will bypass this check
* `verbose_error` - a boolean value to control how much detail any error messages should contain
* `kwargs` - passed to the OS relevant brightness method

**Usage:**  
```python
import screen_brightness_control as sbc

#set brightness to 50%
sbc.set_brightness(50)

#set brightness to 0%
sbc.set_brightness(0, force=True)

#increase brightness by 25%
sbc.set_brightness('+25')

#decrease brightness by 30%
sbc.set_brightness('-30')

#set the brightness of display 0 to 50%
sbc.set_brightness(50, display=0)
```  


### fade_brightness(`finish, start=None, interval=0.01, increment=1, blocking=True, **kwargs`)
**Summary:**  
Fades the brightness from `start` to `finish` in steps of `increment`, pausing for `interval` seconds between each step.
If it runs in the main thread it will return the final brightness upon success, `ScreenBrightnessError` upon failure. Otherwise it returns the list of thread objects that the process is running in

**Arguments:**

* `finish` - The brightness value to fade to
* `start` - The value to start from. If not specified it defaults to the current brightness
* `interval` - The time interval between each step in brightness
* `increment` - The amount to change the brightness by each step in percent.
* `blocking` - If set to `False` it fades the brightness in a new thread
* `kwargs` - passed to `set_brightness`

**Usage:**  
```python
import screen_brightness_control as sbc

#fade brightness from the current brightness to 50%
sbc.fade_brightness(50)

#fade the brightness from 25% to 75%
sbc.fade_brightness(75, start=25)

#fade the brightness from the current value to 100% in steps of 10%
sbc.fade_brightness(100, increment=10)

#fade the brightness from 100% to 90% with time intervals of 0.1 seconds
sbc.fade_brightness(90, start=100, interval=0.1)

#fade the brightness to 100% in a new thread
sbc.fade_brightness(100, blocking=False)
```

# FAQ
### Why is there no support for DDC/CI commands on Linux?
I'm working on it, however, I am struggling to find a way to implement it without root being required every time the program is called.
If you have any suggestions feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/Crozzers/screen_brightness_control/issues),
[pull request](https://github.com/Crozzers/screen_brightness_control/pulls) or to [ping me an email](mailto:captaincrozzers@gmail.com)

### Why do I always get `ScreenBrightnessError` on Linux?
**Why this happens:**  
The way brightness is adjusted on Linux is the program tries to run shell commands to adjust the brightness.
The programs it attempts to call are "light", "xrandr" and "xbacklight".
If none of these programs can be called a `ScreenBrightnessError` is raised

**How to fix it:**  
Install light (recommended), xrandr or xbacklight using your system package manager:

* Arch: `sudo pacman -S light-git` or `sudo pacman -S xorg-xrandr` or `sudo pacman -S xorg-xbacklight`
* Debian/Ubuntu: [Light install instructions](https://github.com/haikarainen/light) or `sudo apt install x11-server-utils` or `sudo apt install xbacklight`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install light` or `sudo dnf install libXrandr` or `sudo dnf install xbacklight`


### I call `set_brightness()` and nothing happens on Linux
**Why this happens:**  
Light requires root access to run, which is usually provided when you manually install it using you package manager.
If you installed xbacklight or xrandr, it only supports Intel (and sometimes NVidia) graphics, not AMD.

**How to fix it:**  
Install Light by following [these steps](https://github.com/haikarainen/light#installation). Make sure to run the install as sudo


### Using the `display` kwarg does nothing/creates exceptions on Linux
**Why this happens:**  
The `display` kwarg is only supported by the `Light` and `XRandr` classes, not by `XBacklight`. So if you only have `xbacklight` installed on your system this kwarg will not work

**How to fix it:**  
Install light (recommended) or xrandr using your system package manager:

* Arch: `sudo pacman -S light-git` or `sudo pacman -S xorg-xrandr`
* Debian/Ubuntu: [Light install instructions](https://github.com/haikarainen/light) or `sudo apt install x11-server-utils`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install light` or `sudo dnf install libXrandr`


### The model of my monitor/display is not what the program says it is (Windows)
**Why this happens:**  
If your display is a laptop screen and can be adjusted via a Windows brightness slider then there is no easy way to get the monitor model that I am aware of.
If your display is a desktop monitor with a Virtual Control Panel (VCP) then there is a way to get the actual model, but the function call takes
anywhere between 1 and 2 seconds to run, which is why it doesn't automatically.
To get the actual model number use this:
```python
import screen_brightness_control as sbc
sbc.list_monitors()
> ['BenQ BNQ78A7', 'Dell DEL405E']
monitor = sbc.windows.Monitor('BenQ BNQ78A7') # swap this argument for the preferred monitor name
print(monitor.model_name)
> 'GL2450HM'
```

### When I call `get_brightness()` the returned value isn't what I set it to (Windows)
Not all monitors can set the brightness for every value between 0 and 100. Most of them have a number of 'levels' that they can set them to.
You can likely see this if you open your display settings and very slowly move the brightness slider.  
You can find out your brightness 'levels' by running the following python code:
```python
import wmi
monitor = wmi.WMI(namespace='wmi').MonitorBrightness[0]
#the number of levels the monitor can be set to
print(monitor.Levels)
#the actual brightness values your monitor can be set to
print(monitor.Level)
```

# Things to note:
* If you encounter any issues or bugs with this software please do not hesitate to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Crozzers/screen_brightness_control/issues) or to email me [captaincrozzers@gmail.com](mailto:captaincrozzers@gmail.com)
* It is unlikely that this project will support MAC in the forseeable future for 3 reasons.
    1. I do not own a (working) MAC.
    2. I do not intend to buy a MAC
    3. From what I have found it is even less straight-forward to adjust the screen brightness from python on MAC
* If you own a MAC an you happen to know how to adjust the brightness in python then feel free to contribute
