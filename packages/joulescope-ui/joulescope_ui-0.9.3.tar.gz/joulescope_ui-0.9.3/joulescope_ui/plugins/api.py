"""This module defines the Joulescope UI plugin interface.

A plugin must be a valid python module with definitions:
* PLUGIN: A dict containing the plugin metadata, including any configuration
  options that are available to the user.
* plugin_register: A function(PluginServiceAPI)
  that registers the module's functionality.

The plugin module may contain other definitions and statements,
but they are not used directly by the plugin API.  For a basic example,
see the example_01.py file.
