Description: 
        # Joulescope UI
        
        Welcome to Joulescope™!  Joulescope is an affordable, precision DC energy 
        analyzer that enables you to build better products.
        Joulescope™ accurately and simultaneously measures the voltage and current 
        supplied to your target device, and it then computes power and energy. 
        For more information on Joulescope, see 
        [www.joulescope.com](https://www.joulescope.com).
        
        This repository contains the Joulescope graphical user interface (UI).
        The UI runs on a host computer and communicates with the Joulescope device 
        over USB.  The application source code is available at 
        https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.  
        
        For the list of changes by release, see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
        
        The Joulescope UI is under active development, and many features remain 
        outstanding. See the [future features document](features_future.md) for details.
        
        
        ## Quick start using official distribution
        
        We provide an official distribution that is prebuit for Windows, macOS and
        Ubuntu 20.04LTS. 
        [Download](https://www.joulescope.com/download) the application distribution
        for your platform and install it.  
        
        
        ## Run as python package
        
        The Joulescope UI is a python package which you can install for pypi or
        run directly from source.
        
        
        ### Install Python
        
        The Joulescope User Interface requires Python 3.6 or newer.  We recommend Python 3.8 or 3.9.
        Install [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) on your system and then verify
        your python version at the terminal or command line:
        
            > python3 -VV
            Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, Oct  5 2020, 15:34:40) [MSC v.1927 64 bit (AMD64)]
            
        Ensure that you have Python 3.6 or newer and 64-bit.
        
        
        ### Configure virtualenv [optional]
        
        Although not required, using 
        [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
        avoids dependency conflicts, especially if you use your python installation for 
        other programs.  Using virtualenv ensures that
        the Joulescope software has the right dependencies without changing the rest
        of your system.
        
        
        #### For Windows:
        
        Install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment:
        
            pip3 install -U virtualenv
            virtualenv c:\venv\joulescope
        
        Activate the virtual environment whenever you start a new terminal:
        
            c:\venv\joulescope\Scripts\activate
        
        
        #### For POSIX including (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):
        
        Install virtualenv and create a new virtual environment:
        
            pip3 install -U virtualenv
            virtualenv ~/venv/joulescope
            
        Activate the virtual environment whenever you start a new terminal:
            
            source ~/venv/joulescope/bin/activate
            
        
        ### Option 1: Install from pypi
        
        Installation from pypi is easy!
        
            pip3 install -U joulescope_ui
        
        
        ### Option 2: Clone and run from source
        
        Clone and configure the Joulescope UI from the terminal or command line:
        
            git clone https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui.git
            cd pyjoulescope_ui
            pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
            
        You can then run from this directory:
        
            python3 -m joulescope_ui
            
        You can alternatively build and install from source:
        
            python3 setup.py sdist
            python3 install dist/joulescope_ui-{version}.tar.gz
        
        If you see an error importing win32api on Windows, you should try running this
        command from an Administrator command prompt:
        
           python {path_to_python}\scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
        
        
        ### Simultaneously develop the Joulescope driver
        
        If you also want to simultaneously develop the Joulescope UI and the 
        Joulescope driver:
        
            pip3 uninstall joulescope
            cd {path/to/repos}
            git clone https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope.git
            cd pyjoulescope
            pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt    
            python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
        
        You should then modify your python path. On Windows:
        
            set PYTHONPATH={C:\path\to\repos}\pyjoulescope;{C:\path\to\repos}\pyjoulescope_ui
        
        and on POSIX (Linux, Mac OS X with homebrew):
        
            export PYTHONPATH={path/to/repos}/pyjoulescope:{path/to/repos}/pyjoulescope_ui
        
        You should then be able to run the user interface from this directory:
        
            python3 -m joulescope_ui
