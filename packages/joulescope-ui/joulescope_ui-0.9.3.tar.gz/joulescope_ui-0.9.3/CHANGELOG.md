## 0.6.10

2019 Oct 23

*   Fixed current range glitch filter using invalid sample data.
    The glitch filter could occasionally use one sample of invalid data during
    the computation of the "pre" mean component.  The underlying cause was 
    that the pre mean value was computed over a FIFO that was rolling over 1 
    sample too late.  This injected up to one sample of undefined data. 
    For a length n pre value, this error occurred on roughly (n - 1) / 8 
    current range transitions.  Testing shows that we were lucky on 
    Win10 and the data was not a huge floating point number.
    Added unit test and fixed.
*   Added support for new download.joulescope.com site.
    Support new https://download.joulescope.com/joulescope_install/index.json 
    format.
    Modified URLS to point directly to https://download.joulescope.com rather 
    than https://www.joulescope.com.


## 0.6.8

2019 Oct 15

*   Fixed data-dependent single NaN sample insertion. Only occurred when
    i_range was 3 or 7 and current LSBs was saturated.
    Affects 0.6.0 through 0.6.7.
*   Added customizable current range switching filter available through 
    File → Preferences → Current Ranging.
*   Changed default current range switch filter from mean_0_3_1 to mean_1_n_1,
    which significantly reduces the displayed glitches on current ranging.
    If you like the old behavior, File → Preferences → Current Ranging to
    set type: mean, samples_pre: 0, samples_window: 3, samples_post: 1.
    The drawback is that up to 8 samples (4 µs) of data can be filtered out.


## 0.6.6

2019 Oct 9

* Fixed configuration to work on new installations (error introduced in 0.6.5).

2019 Sep 17

    pyinstaller EXE packaging.
*   Applied calibration to "zoomed-out" data on dual marker export. All existing
    files created with dual marker export are invalid when the view window is
    more than a couple seconds (actual duration varies), but the zoomed-in
    data is still valid.

    performance.  Allows software to condense multiple requests, such as
    during mouse click & drag.

    not cause sample drops.
