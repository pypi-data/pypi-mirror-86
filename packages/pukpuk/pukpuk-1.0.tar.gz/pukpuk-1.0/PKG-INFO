        ## About
        
        Pukpuk ("pook-pook") is a tool for discovering and monitoring HTTP services. It simply grabs screens and responses, and stores them in a directory. It is especially useful in the initial phase of any assignment to find vulnerable Web applications, forgotten devices, directories listing source code or backups. Results are easily greppable. When monitoring, a good practice is to store the results in a repository so it is easier to track changes. Apart from port scanning `pukpuk` also does reverse DNS lookup and certificate parsing. Quite often certificates reveal extra virtual hosts or domain names.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 3.x
        * Chrome / Chromium for screen grabbing functionality
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Default OS nameserver, using `chromium` and default ports (80/http, 443/https)
        
            pukpuk -c 10.0.0.0/24
        
        ### Custom nameserver and ports, using `chrome.exe`
        
            pukpuk -c 10.0.0.0/24 -r 84.200.69.80 -e chrome.exe -p 80/http 443/https 8000/http 8443/https
        
        ### Use IP list instead of CIDR notation
        
            pukpuk -l hosts.txt
        
        ### Or skip the discovery phase and provide a CSV file (format: 192.168.1.1,443,https)
        
            pukpuk -i targets.csv
        
        ## Installation

        ## Changelog
        
        ### 1.0
        
        * Updated Python requirements
        * Removed timestamps from file names, no longer needed and makes it easier to diff and track with source versioning
        * Strip whitespaces when loading CSV files
        * Results now end up in separate subdirectories named after modules
        * FIXED: Issue with loading from CSV files
        
        ### 0.5
        
        * CSV input and discovery phase skipping
        * Minor improvements in logging and storing results
        
        ### 0.4
        
        * Simplified usage: removed option to launch selected modules since there are only two for now
        * Creates directory for storing results by default
        * Saves logging output by default
        * Less detailed logging at info level
        * Adjusted default timeouts
        * Added usage examples
        
        ### 0.3
        
        * Graceful exit, cancelling steps
        * Remove blank screenshots
        * Added timestamp to default logging level
        
        ### 0.2
