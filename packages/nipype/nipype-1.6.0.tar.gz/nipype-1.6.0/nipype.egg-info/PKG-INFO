        NIPYPE: Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces
        ========================================================
        
        Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to
        analyze data using a variety of different algorithms. However, this has
        resulted in a heterogeneous collection of specialized applications
        without transparent interoperability or a uniform operating interface.
        
        *Nipype*, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
        umbrella of `NiPy <http://nipy.org>`_, is a Python project that provides a
        uniform interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction
        between these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment
        that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from different
        packages (e.g., AFNI, ANTS, BRAINS, BrainSuite, Camino, FreeSurfer, FSL, MNE,
        MRtrix, MNE, Nipy, Slicer, SPM), eases the design of workflows within and
        between packages, and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.
        
        *Nipype* allows you to:
        
        * easily interact with tools from different software packages
        * combine processing steps from different software packages
        * develop new workflows faster by reusing common steps from old ones
        * process data faster by running it in parallel on many cores/machines
        * make your research easily reproducible
        * share your processing workflows with the community
