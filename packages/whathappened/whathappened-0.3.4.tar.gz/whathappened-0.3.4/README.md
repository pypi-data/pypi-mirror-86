# whathappened
A changelog generator using simply structured git commit messages

## Inspired by

* [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
* [Angular Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
* [Auto Changelog](https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/auto-changelog)
* [git_commits.py](https://gist.github.com/simonw/091b765a071d1558464371042db3b959#file-get_commits-py)

## Install and Run

Installation is as simple as it gets:

    $ pip install whathappened

To generate a changelog, run:

    $ whathappened

Make sure to activate any virtual envrionment that you might be using first.

Some options are available:

    $ whathappened --help
    Usage: whathappened [OPTIONS] [GIT_LOG_ARGS]...

      Handle command line arguments. Extra arguments are passed to 'git log'.

    Options:
      -o, --output PATH  The changelog destination [default: stdout]
      -e, --emoji        Include emoji in headings if present
      -p, --prefix TEXT  Version prefix, often 'version' or 'v' [default: '']
      --version          Show the version and exit.
      --help             Show this message and exit.

To limit the range of commits, add a [`revision range`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt-ltrevisionrangegt) argument.

To create a changelog of commits that are yet to be pushed:

    $ whathappened origin..HEAD

To create a changelog of commits between (branch: main) and (tag: v1.0.0) and write the output to file:

    $ whathappened -o CHANGELOG.md main..v1.0.0

## Package Changelog

Created by Whathappened itself - very meta.

For the complete changelog, please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Whathappened Commit Message Format

Whathappened expects git commit messages in the format outlined below:

    [optional breaking ]<type>[ optional (<scope>)]: <description>

    [optional body]

`<type>` is recommended to be one of:

    fix
    feat
    build
    ci
    docs
    style
    refactor
    perf
    test

Variations on these types like `feat, feature, features`, or `doc, docs` are seamlessly grouped together.

`<scope>` is recommended to be a module, file, or folder name as appropiate.

For a nice summary of `type`s and what they mean, please see [Understanding Semantic Commit Messages Using Git and Angular](https://nitayneeman.com/posts/understanding-semantic-commit-messages-using-git-and-angular/).

## Emoji

Adding the --emoji flag will add emoji after each heading in the changelog. Below is the list of emoji that are used:

* Docs 📝
* Features ✨
* Fixes 🐛
* Performance ⚡️
* Refactorings ♻️
* Other 🃏 

### Examples

All of the examples below are acceptable commit message formats:

The simplest message:

    style: isn't it neat

Defining scope:

    docs(gadgets): remember the gizmos

Signalling a breaking change

    breaking feat: add the whozits

Defining scope, including a space:

    fix (whatsits): repair the thingamabobs

Multiple lines:

    test: How many have I got?

    I've got twenty
    But who cares?

    I want more

For more examples, please see whathappened's own [commits](https://github.com/Rollcloud/whathappened/commits/).
