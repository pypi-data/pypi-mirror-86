Description: # Conan Center Bot
        
        This is a library to help update recipes in conan-center-index.
        
        The library will scan a conan-center-index repository as well as
        all recipes's upstream to try to find which recipes can be updated.
        
        It can then either generates the list of updatable recipes, or
        automatically update a recipe to the latest upstream version.
        
        ## How to use the data
        
        ### Human-readable
        
        You can check the [status page](https://qchateau.github.io/conan-center-bot/)
        or the github issues https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/3470 and

        ### API
        
        You can get the updatability status of CCI recipes by reading the
        files in https://github.com/qchateau/conan-center-bot/tree/status.
        
        They are auto-updated daily using Github Actions.

          --jobs JOBS, -j JOBS  Number of parallel processes.
        ```
        
        ### Update a recipe
        
        ```
        usage: conan-center-bot update [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] [--cci CCI] [--github-token GITHUB_TOKEN] [--force] [--choose-version] [--folder FOLDER] [--push] [--no-test] [recipe [recipe ...]]
        
        positional arguments:
          recipe                List of recipes to update.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --verbose, -v         Verbosity level
          --quiet, -q
          --cci CCI             Path to the conan-center-index repository. Defaults to '../conan-center-index'
          --github-token GITHUB_TOKEN
                                Github authentication token
          --force, -f           Overwrite the branch if it exists, force push if the remote branch exists.
          --choose-version      Choose which upstream version to use (defaults to the latest)
          --folder FOLDER       Choose which recipe folder to use (default to the latest)
          --push                Push the new branch to origin
          --no-test             Do not test the updated recipe
        ```
        
        To auto-update and test a recipe, run
        
        ```bash
        conan-center-bot update <recipe-name> --push --cci <path-to-cci>
        ```
        
        After you ran the script:
        
        - Verify and maybe tweak the diff in the new branch
        - Open a PR on CCI
        
        ## Limitations
        
        - Only projects on GitHub are supported.
        - Some versioning patterns are too specific to be supported.
        - Recipes require a config.yml file.
