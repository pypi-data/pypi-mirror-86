        JavaScript and CSS.
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            make ui
        
        Running in Development
        ----------------------
        Perform the following steps to run Imbi in the foreground in your development
        environment.

            make setup
            source env/bin/activate
            source build/test-environment
            imbi
