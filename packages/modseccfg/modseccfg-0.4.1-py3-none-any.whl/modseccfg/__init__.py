# Correlates mod_security SecRules to logs, and simplifies
# disabling unneeded rules. It's very basic and not gonna
# win any usability awards.
# BE WARNED THAT ALPHA RELEASES MAY DAMAGE YOUR APACHE SETUP.
#
# Basically you select your desired vhost *.conf file, then
# hit [Disable] for rules with a high error.log count - if it's
# false positives. Preferrably leave rules untouched that are
# indeed working as intended.
