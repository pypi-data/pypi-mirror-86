# Basically like SecOptions, but for CRS options (from crs-setup.conf).
# But this module will not replace them, but inject a combined SecAction,
# which overrides all variables in one swoop.
#
# Hence it requires declaring an id. Default is 5999 in the user range.
# If the distributed crs-setup.conf is targeted, you want to set the id
# to 900999 instead, so it applies AFTER all SecActions in there.
# (We could add another mode to update individual SecAction entries, but
# that's probably too detailobsessed.)

If you encounter FPs, please\nopen an issue on the CRS GitHub site and don't forget to attach your\ncomplete Audit Log record for the request with the issue.\n- Paranoia level 2 includes many extra rules, for instance enabling\nmany regexp-based SQL and XSS injection protections, and adding\nextra keywords checked for code injections. PL2 is advised\nfor moderate to experienced users desiring more complete coverage\nand for installations with elevated security requirements.\nPL2 comes with some FPs which you need to handle.\n- Paranoia level 3 enables more rules and keyword lists, and tweaks\nlimits on special characters used. PL3 is aimed at users experienced\nat the handling of FPs and at installations with a high security\nrequirement.\n- Paranoia level 4 further restricts special characters.\nThe highest level is advised for experienced users protecting\ninstallations with very high security requirements.
