Description: # [xsession-manager](https://github.com/nlpsuge/xsession-manager)
        
        Python-based command line tool to save and restore sessions for X11 desktops like Gnome, 
        and other features to maintain sessions. The project is currently in an early stage of development.
        
        This project was written in ```Bash``` originally. But now I'm completely rewriting it in ```Python```
        which obviously makes it way more flexible, extensible.
        
        This project relies on [wmctrl](http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/), which is why you have to install it beforehand.
        
        ## Install
        ### Install dependencies
        #### Fedora 33
        ```Bash
        dnf install python3-devel python3-tkinter wmctrl
        ```
        
        ## Usage:
        
        ```
        usage: xsm [-h] [-s [SAVE]] [-c [CLOSE_ALL ...]] [-im] [-r [RESTORE]] [-ri RESTORING_INTERVAL] [-pr [PR]] [-l] [-t DETAIL]
                   [-x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [-i INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]] [-ma [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY]]
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -s [SAVE], --save [SAVE]
                                Save the current session. Save to the default session if not specified a session name.
          -c [CLOSE_ALL ...], --close-all [CLOSE_ALL ...]
                                Close the windows gracefully. Close all windows if only -c/--close-all is present. You can specify
                                arguments to tell me which windows should be closed, that is <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or
                                <title_name> exactly the same as -x.
          -im, --including-apps-with-multiple-windows
                                Close the windows gracefully including apps with multiple windows
          -r [RESTORE], --restore [RESTORE]
                                Restore a session gracefully. Restore the default session if not specified a session name.
          -ri RESTORING_INTERVAL, --restoring-interval RESTORING_INTERVAL
                                Specify the interval between restoring applications, in seconds. The default is 2 seconds.
          -pr [PR]              Pop up a dialog to ask user whether to restore a X session.
          -l, --list            List the sessions.
          -t DETAIL, --detail DETAIL
                                Check out the details of a session.
          -x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...], --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                                Exclude apps from the operation according to <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or <title_name>. Require
                                at least one value
          -i INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...], --include INCLUDE [INCLUDE ...]
                                Include apps from the operation according to <window_id>, <pid>, <app_name> or <title_name>. Require
                                at least one value
          -ma [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY], --move-automatically [MOVE_AUTOMATICALLY]
                                Auto move windows to specified workspaces according to a saved session. The default session is
                                `xsession-default`
        
        ```
        
        ## If you want to restore the previous X session automatically after login
        Here is a solution. If you are using Fedora, create a file named ```auto-restore-working-state.desktop``` and the ```Exec``` should be:
        ```bash
        xsession-manager -pr
        ```
        Then put this file into ```~/.config/autostart```.
