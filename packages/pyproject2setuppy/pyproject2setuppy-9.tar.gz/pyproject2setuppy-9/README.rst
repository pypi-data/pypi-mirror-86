pyproject2setuppy -- a cheap build for pyproject.toml-based systems
===================================================================

pyproject2setuppy is a tool to install ``pyproject.toml``-based packages
using plain setuptools_.  It maps the project metadata into ``setup()``
call arguments, making it possible to build them without installing
the dependency hell of the new build systems.


Supported features
------------------
Currently the following build systems are supported:

- flit_
- poetry_

Only minimal build/install functionality is supported.  Dependencies
and ``sdist``-related information are not propagated.

Scripts and entry points are not supported at the moment.  This is
subject to change in the future.

Unlike the upstream build systems, this package has been tested to work
correctly both with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+.


Dependencies
------------
The runtime (and build time, if using ``setup.py``) dependencies are:

- toml_ (to read ``pyproject.toml``)
- setuptools_ (to provide fully-featured ``setup.py`` commands)


Testing
-------
The package provides unittest-compatible test suite.  However, due
to setuptools output it is recommended to run them using pytest_::

    $ pytest -vv

Testing on Python 2 requires additional compatibility modules installed:

- backports.tempfile_
- mock_


Installation
------------
pyproject2setuppy is using a flit-compliant ``pyproject.toml``.
It includes ``setup.py`` that uses itself to maintain setuptools
compatibility.  Note that the latter does not install package's
dependencies.


Usage
-----
In order to use pyproject2setuppy to build a ``pyproject.toml``-based
project, either copy the included ``setup.py`` to the project's
directory or call the entry point directly, e.g.::

    $ python -m pyproject2setuppy.main build
