        PoseCamera is Socket based SDK for multi human pose estimation through RGB webcam. You can integrate this SDK into any programming language. 
        
        ### Quick Start
        The official docker image is hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wondertree/posecamera). The very first step is to install the docker [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system. You can also use ```pose-cli.py``` locally with installing all dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt```. 
        > Also note that your Nvidia driver Needs to be compatible with CUDA10.2.
        
        Doing inference on live webcam feed.
        ```sh
        xhost +; docker run --name posecamera --rm --gpus all -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 wondertree/posecamera --video=0
        ```
        > GPU & Webcam support (if running docker) is not available on Windows Operating System. 
        
        To run inference on images use following command.
        ```sh
        docker run --name posecamera --rm -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY  wondertree/posecamera --images ./tmp/female_pose.jpg --cpu
        ```
