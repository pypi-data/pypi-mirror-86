        SoundScrape |Build Status| |Python 3| |PyPI|
        ============================================
        
        **SoundScrape** makes it super easy to download artists from SoundCloud
        (and Bandcamp and MixCloud) - even those which don't have download
        links! It automatically creates ID3 tags as well (including album art),
        which is handy.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, install it:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install soundscrape
        
        Note that if you are having problems, please first try updating to the
        latest version:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install soundscrape --upgrade
        
        Then, just call soundscrape and the name of the artist you want to
        scrape:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape rabbit-i-am
        
        And you're done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format **Artist
        name - Track title.mp3**.
        
        You can also use the *-n* argument to only download a certain number of
        songs.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape rabbit-i-am -n 3
        
        Sets
        ----
        
        Soundscrape can also download sets, but you have to include the full URL
        of the set you want to download:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/vsauce-awesome/sets/awesome
        
        Groups
        ------
        
        Soundscrape can also download tracks from SoundCloud groups with the
        *-g* argument.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape chopped-and-screwed -gn 2
        
        Tracks
        ------
        
        Soundscrape can also download specific tracks with *-t*:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape foolsgoldrecs -t danny-brown-dip
        
        or with just the straight URL:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/danny-brown-dip
        
        Likes
        -----
        
        Soundscrape can also download all of an Artist's Liked items with *-l*:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape troyboi -l
        
        or with just the straight URL:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/troyboi/likes
        
        High-Quality Downloads Only
        ---------------------------
        
        By default, SoundScrape will try to rip everything it can. However, if
        you only want to download tracks that have an official download
        available (which are typically at a higher-quality 320kbps bitrate), you
        can use the *-d* argument.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape sly-dogg -d
        
        Keep Preview Tracks
        -------------------
        
        By default, SoundScrape will skip the 30-second preview tracks that
        SoundCloud now provides. You can choose to keep these preview snippets
        with the *-k* argument.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape chromeo -k
        
        Folders
        -------
        
        By default, SoundScrape aims to act like *wget*, downloading in place in
        the current directory. With the *-f* argument, however, SoundScrape acts
        more like a download manager and sorts songs into the following format:
        
        ::
        
            ./ARTIST_NAME - ALBUM_NAME/SONG_NUMBER - SONG_TITLE.mp3
        
        It will also skip previously downloaded tracks.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape murdercitydevils -f
        
        Bandcamp
        --------
        
        SoundScrape can also pull down albums from Bandcamp. For Bandcamp pages,
        use the *-b* argument along with an artist's username or a specific URL.
        It only downloads one album at a time. This works with all of the other
        arguments, except *-d* as Bandcamp streams only come at one bitrate, as
        far as I can tell.
        
        Note: Currently, when using the *-n* argument, the limit is evaluated
        for each album separately.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape warsaw -b -f
        
        This also works for non-Bandcamp URLs that are hosted on Bandcamp:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape -b http://music.monstercat.com/
        
        Note that the full URL must be included.
        
        Mixcloud
        --------
        
        SoundScrape can also grab mixes from Mixcloud. This feature is extremely
        expermental and is in no way guaranteed to work!
        
        Finds the original mp3 of a mix and grabs that (with tags and album art)
        if it can, or else just gets the raw m4a stream.
        
        Mixcloud currently only takes an invidiual mix. Capacity for a whole
        artist's profile due shortly.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape https://www.mixcloud.com/corenewsuploads/flume-essential-mix-2015-10-03/ -of
        
        Audiomack
        ---------
        
        Just for fun, SoundScrape can also download individual songs from
        Audiomack. Not that you'd ever want to.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape -a http://www.audiomack.com/song/bottomfeedermusic/top-shottas
        
        MusicBed
        --------
        
        For some strange reason, it also works for MusicBed.com. Thanks @brachna
        for this feature.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape https://www.musicbed.com/albums/be-still/2828
        
        Opening Files
        -------------
        
        As a convenience method, SoundScrape can automatically *'open'* files
        that it downloads. This uses your system's 'open' command for file
        associations.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            soundscrape lorn -of
        
        Issues
        ------
        
        There's probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Please
        file issues if you find them!
