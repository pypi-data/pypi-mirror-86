Model gallery
=============

In general the models are grouped into the following categories:

- `~gammapy.modeling.models.SpectralModel`: models to describe spectral shapes of sources
- `~gammapy.modeling.models.SpatialModel`: models to describe spatial shapes (morphologies) of sources
- `~gammapy.modeling.models.TemporalModel`: models to describe temporal flux evolution of sources, such as light and phase curves
- `~gammapy.modeling.models.SkyModel` and `~gammapy.modeling.models.SkyDiffuseCube`: model to combine the spectral and spatial model components

The models follow a naming scheme which contains the category as a suffix to the class
name.

The model gallery provides a visual overview of the available models in Gammapy.
