Description: REGENS (REcombinatory Genome ENumeration of Subpopulations) is an open source Python package that simulates whole genomes from real genomic segments. REGENS recombines these segments in a way that simulates completely new individuals while simultaneously preserving the input genomes' linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern with extremely high fedility. REGENS can also simulate mono-allelic and epistatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) effects on a continuous or binary phenotype without perturbing the simulated LD pattern.
