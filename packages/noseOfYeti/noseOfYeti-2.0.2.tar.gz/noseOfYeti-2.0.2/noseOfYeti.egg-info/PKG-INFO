Description: Nose of Yeti
        ============
        
        This is a project creates a custom Python ``codec`` that lets you write your
        tests using an RSpec inspired DSL (i.e. ``describe`` and ``it`` blocks)
        
        It uses the fact that you can register a codec that is able to modify a Python
        file before executing it.
        
        http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html
        
        Using this we can make it so that when Python imports a file with a particular
        encoding as the first line of the file it will be intercepted and potentially
        rewritten into something else before the import continues.
        
        nose-of-yeti uses this technique to translate from the DSL it defines, into 
        Python classes and functions that then will be executed by your test framework
        of choice.
        
        It was originally developed by Stephen Moore after borrowing the idea from a
        project by Fernando Meyer called Yeti

        Updating nose-of-yeti version
        -----------------------------
        
        It is recommended you remove .pyc of your nose-of-yeti specs when you
        upgrade nose-of-yeti. The Python interpreter skips the translation process if it
        sees a .pyc file (unless the .py file has changed since the .pyc file was
        created). This means that any changes in the translation process won't happen
        until either the .pyc files are removed or all the .py files have been changed.
