xmldirector.connector
=====================


``xmldirector.connector`` integrates  Plone 5 with 

- local filesystem
- WebDAV-backed backend
- AWS S3
- remote servers over SFTP/SSH

``xmldirector.connector`` provides a ``Connector`` content-type that
mounts a particular storage into Plone. 

No support for indexing and search mounted content.



Requirements
------------

- Plone 5.2 with Python 3.6 or higher (tested)

- Supported backends:

    - eXist-db 

    - Base-X 

    - OwnCloud
    
    - Alfresco

    - Marklogic Server

    - AWS S3

    - Cloud federation services

      - Otixo.com
      - Storagemadeeasy.com


Configuration
-------------

Goto the Plone control panel and click on the ``XML-Director Connector`` configlet and
configure the your service

ExistDB
+++++++
  
- `webdav://localhost:6080/existdb/webdav/db`
- username and password required to access your XML database over WebDAV

BaseX
+++++

- `webdav://localhost:8984/webdav`                                     
- username and password required to access your XML database over WebDAV

Owncloud
++++++++

- `webdav://hostname:port/remote.php/webdav`
- username and password required to access your Owncloud instance over WebDAV

Alfresco
++++++++

- `webdav://hostname:port/webdav`
- username and password required to access your Alfresco instance over WebDAV

Local filesystem
++++++++++++++++

- `file:///path/to/some/directory`
- no support for credentials, the referenced filesystem must be readable (and writable)

AWS S3
++++++
    
- `s3://bucketname`
- enter your AWS access key as username and the AWS secret key as password
  (You need to install the Python package `fs-s3fs` through buildout).

SSH/SFTP
++++++++

- `ssh://hostname.com` or `sftp://hostname.com`
  (You need to install the Python package `fs.sshfs` through buildout).



API notes
+++++++++

The implementation of `xmldirector.connector` is heavily backed by the PyFilesystem 2 API.
Every `Connector` instance in Plone gives you access to the mounted storage through the 
`handle = connector.get_handle()` call which is instance of `fs.base.FS`. Check
https://docs.pyfilesystem.org for details.

Security
++++++++

The mounted storage gives you access to all contents inside the mounted
subtree.  The mounted filesystem is sandboxed
(https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/concepts.html#sandboxing). So you can
not escape and access content outside the mounted storage.

Available drivers
+++++++++++++++++

Connectivity with other backend is accomplished through dedicated driverse that implementation
the API layer between PyFilesystem 2 and the related backend. 
See https://www.pyfilesystem.org/page/index-of-filesystems/ for all available drivers.
