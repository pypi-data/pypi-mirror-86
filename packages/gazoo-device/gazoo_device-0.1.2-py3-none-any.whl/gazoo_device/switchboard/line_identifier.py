"""Used to identify device output lines as Log, Response, or Unknown.

AllUnknownIdentifier (default) which classifies all lines
from all ports as unknown and accepts them for every line_type provided.

AllLogIdentifier classifies all lines from all ports as log lines and only
accepts them for "all" or "log" line_type values.

AllResponseIdentifier classifies all lines from all ports as response lines
and only accepts them for "all" or "response" line_type values.

PortLogIdentifier classifies lines from a particular port as log lines.
All others are responses.

RegexLogIdentifier classifies lines that match a regex as log lines.
All others are unknown.

RegexResponseIdentifier classifies lines that match a regex as response lines.
All others are unknown.
