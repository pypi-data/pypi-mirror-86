"""Defines Switchboard processes responsible for writing and filtering logs.

The LogFilterProcess is responsible for tailing the log file specified and
producing filter events into the event file specified according to the
following assumptions:

    * The log file will be flushed frequently.

    * If an event file path is not provided then "-events.txt" will be added to
      the log file path provided.

The LogWriterProcess is responsible for receiving log lines added externally
to the provided log_queue and write them to a log file as quickly as possible
according to the following assumptions:

    * Log lines all have a host system timestamp added before being added
      to log queue.

    * Partial log lines contain no newline character at the end

    * Log lines missing a newline character will have one added when written

    * Log lines are queued in the correct order to be written to the log file
