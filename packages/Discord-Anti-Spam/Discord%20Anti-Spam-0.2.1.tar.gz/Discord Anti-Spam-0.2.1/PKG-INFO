        Ever felt the need to handle spammers in your discord, but don't have the time or effort to do so yourself? 
        This package aims to help solve that issue by handling all the required logic under the hood, as well as handling the spammers heh.
        
        *I decided to create this after seeing a d.js alternative but not one for d.py, as far as I know.*

        How to use this right now?
        
        Download the codebase:
        ```
        > pip install Discord-Anti-Spam
        ```
        
        A basic bot
        ```python
        from discord.ext import commands
        from AntiSpam import AntiSpamHandler
        
        bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")
        bot.handler = AntiSpamHandler(bot)
        
        @bot.event
        async def on_ready():
            print(f"-----\nLogged in as: {bot.user.name} : {bot.user.id}\n-----")
        
        @bot.event
        async def on_message(message):
            bot.handler.propagate(message)
            await bot.process_commands(message)
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            bot.run("Bot Token")
        ```
        
        And thats it!
        Now, there will no doubt be bugs & changes etc. But, you can use this as is now and all I ask is you create an issue for anything you encounter while using this codebase.

        ### Build Ideology:
        - OOP approach 
        - Scalable -> Multi guild support out of the box
        - Test Driven -> CI with Travis
        
        I hope to maintain the above, however, I currently am attempting to `only` create a `working version`. After such is created, I will begin optimizations, code refactoring and general improvements.
