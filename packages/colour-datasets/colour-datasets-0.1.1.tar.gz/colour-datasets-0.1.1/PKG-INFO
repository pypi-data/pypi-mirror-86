Colour science datasets for use with
`Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__ or any Python package
manipulating colours. The datasets are hosted in `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__
under the
`Colour Science - Datasets <https://zenodo.org/communities/colour-science-datasets/>`__
community.

It is open source and freely available under the
`New BSD License <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ terms.

Features
--------

**Colour - Datasets** was created to overcome issues encountered frequently
when trying to access or use colour science datasets:

-   No straightforward ingestion path for dataset content.
-   No simple loading mechanism for dataset content.
-   Unavailability of the dataset, e.g. download url is down, dataset
    content is passed directly from hand to hand.
-   No information regarding the definitive origination of the dataset.

**Colour - Datasets** offers all the above: it allows users to ingest and load
colour science datasets with a single function call. The datasets information
is hosted on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/colour-science-datasets/>`__
where the record for a dataset typically contain:

-   An *urls.txt* file describing the urls to source the dataset files from.
-   A copy of those files in the eventuality where the source files are not
    available or the content has changed without notice.
-   Information about the authors, content and licensing.

When no explicit licensing information is available, the dataset adopts the
**Other (Not Open)** licensing scheme, implying that assessing usage conditions
is at the sole discretion of the users.

Online
------

**Colour - Datasets** can be used online with
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=1YwIfDTBVP3XUYJAyZVEDWj92DJCB0_3v&offline=true&sandboxMode=true>`__.
