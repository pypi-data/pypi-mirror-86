.SS Why?
.sp
The family computer runs Fedora, has many users and we want to share some files with each other.
To achive this we create a shared common folder.
This package solves the problems that come with our use case.
.SS Features
.sp
This package is intended to perform maintenance over a folder shared across many users in a Fedora Workstation.
The folder should belong to a group for which all users are members.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Go through a folder’s content and enforce common group ownership.
.IP \(bu 2
Go through a folder’s content and enforce common group read and write permissions as
well as set groupid sticky bit.
.IP \(bu 2
Provide a command line command with sane defaults for enforcing common folder group ownership
and permissions.
.IP \(bu 2
Write logs to \fB/tmp/fcust/$USER.log\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Provides user systemd service to periodically enforce common folder group ownership
and permissions. Runs on user log out.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The key problem this package intends to solve is that files moved from one location to another do not inherit
proper permissions in the commonly used folder and therefore when another user tries to access them they encounter
problems.
.SS Quick Start Guide
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Install fcust:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ dnf install python3\-fcust\-0.0.13\-1.fc33.noarch.rpm
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Manually create a common group and add as members the users that will have access to it.
For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ sudo groupadd family
$ sudo usermod \-a \-G family user1
$ sudo usermod \-a \-G family user1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Create that folder and assign proper permissions:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ mkdir /path/to/common/folder/
$ chown :family /path/to/common/folder/
$ chmod 2775 /path/to/common/folder/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Setup fcust:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ fcust setup /path/to/common/folder/
$ fcust activate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
In order to run fcust manually on a properly permissioned common folder run:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ fcust run /path/to/common/folder/
.ft P

.SS Credits
.sp
This package was created with \fI\%Cookiecutter\fP and the \fI\%audreyr/cookiecutter\-pypackage\fP project template.
.SH INSTALLATION
.SS Stable release
.sp
To install Folder Custodian, run this command in your terminal:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install fcust
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the preferred method to install Folder Custodian,
as it will always install the most recent stable release.
.sp
If you don’t have \fI\%pip\fP installed, this \fI\%Python installation guide\fP can guide
you through the process.
.SS From sources
.sp
The sources for Folder Custodian can be downloaded from the \fI\%Github repo\fP\&.
.sp
You can either clone the public repository:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ git clone git://github.com/Iolaum/fcust
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or download the \fI\%tarball\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ curl \-OJL https://github.com/Iolaum/fcust/tarball/master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ python setup.py install
.ft P
.fi

.SH SETTING UP A COMMON FOLDER
.sp
We go through an example of how a Fedora Workstation administrator can set up a common folder.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd /home
# Let\(aqs create two hupothetical users (in a real installation those users would be Fedora Workstation users)
$ sudo useradd \-ms /bin/bash user1
$ sudo useradd \-ms /bin/bash user2
# Let\(aqs create the folder that will be shared across users
$ sudo mkdir family
# create new group
$ sudo groupadd family
# Let\(aqs add our two users to the new group
$ sudo usermod \-a \-G family user1
$ sudo usermod \-a \-G family user2
# Change ownership of folder
$ sudo chown :family ./family/
# Set common folder\(aqs permissions. We can also set the setguid sticky bit for the new folder.
# This option forces newly created objects within the folder to inherit the foler\(aqs group rather than their default group.
$ sudo chmod 2775 ./family/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that even though we used the same name for the group and the folder that is not required.
.sp
The common folder is now ready to be used. The \fBfcust\fP package enforces that all files and
folders in the common folder belong to the common group and that the group has read and write
permissions.
.SH USAGE
.sp
The package provides a command line option to enfoce group ownership and permissions:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
$ fcust /path/to/folder
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfcust\fP will assume the folder is set up correctly and will try to enforce group ownership
and permissions within it.
.SH FCUST

.B class fcust.fcust.CommonFolder(folder_path: pathlib.PosixPath, common_group: str = \(aq\(aq)
Bases: \fBobject\fP
.sp
Main class regarding management of a folder that is commonly used across many users.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
The class creates a logfile at /tmp/fcust/$USER.log
.IP \(bu 2
By default the class assumes that the root of the common folder is configured
correctly and then tries to enforce appropriate permissions.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Parameters
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfolder_path\fP – Path where the common folder is located.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcommon_group\fP – Group name regarding the common folder.
If not passed the existing group of the folder will be assumed to be the proper folder.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B enforce_permissions()
We read the contents of a specified directory and enforce unix permissions.
.sp
Files should have 664 permissions
Folders should have 2775 permisions (ie also setguid bit)
Group should be common golder’s group.
.sp
The function only changes permissions if the user is owner of the relevant resource.
This is done to avoid the need for root access, but requires the function to be
run by all the users sharing the common folder.

.B fcust.service.create_user_unit_path(create_folder: bool = False)
We want to add a systemd user unit to run fcust on certain times. In order to do
this we want to crete a unit at a proper location. According to:
\fI\%https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User\fP
our options are:
.INDENT 7.0

.sp
where units provided by installed packages belong.
.IP \(bu 2
~/.local/share/systemd/user/
.sp
where units of packages that have been installed in the home directory belong.
.IP \(bu 2
/etc/systemd/user/
.sp
where system\-wide user units are placed by the system administrator.
.IP \(bu 2
~/.config/systemd/user/
.sp
where the user puts their own units.
.UNINDENT
.sp
We opt to use the latter choice.
.sp
This function constructs the proper systemd user unit path where it will be installed.
It also creates the necessary folder if it doesn’t exist.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Parameters
\fBcreate_folder\fP – If true create the folder that the unit service will be installed.
.TP
.B Returns
Path object for the location the unit service will be installed.
