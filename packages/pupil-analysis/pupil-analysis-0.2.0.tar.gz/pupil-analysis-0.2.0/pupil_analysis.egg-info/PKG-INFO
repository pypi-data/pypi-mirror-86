Description: <h1>Pseudopupil Analysis suite</h1>
        Specialised spatial motion analysis software for Pupil Imsoft data.
        
        In general, can be used for data that follows hierarchy

        <h2>Installing</h2>
        
        There are two supported installation ways at the moment.
        On Windows, the stand-alone installer is probably the best option unless you are familiar with Python.
        On other platforms, use pip.
        
        <h3>Installer on Windows (easiest)</h3>
        
        A Windows installer that bundles together Pseudopupil Analysis suite and all its depencies,
        including a complete Python runtime, is provided at
        [Releases](https://github.com/jkemppainen/pupil-analysis/releases).
        
        The installer creates a start menu shorcut called <em>Pupil Analysis</em>,
        which can be used to launch the GUI.
        
        To uninstall, use <em>Add or Remove programs</em> feature in Windows.
        
        <h3>Using pip (the python standard way)</h3>
        
        The latest version from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) can be installed with the command
        
        ```
        pip install pupil-analysis
        ```
        
        This should install all the required dependencies, except when on Windows, OpenCV may require
        [Visual C++ Runtime 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48145) to be installed.
        
        
        Afterwards, to upgrade an existing installation to the latest version
        
        ```
        pip install --upgrade pupil-analysis
        ```
        
        In case of regressions, a specific version of the suite (for example 0.1.2) can be installed
        
        ```
        pip install pupil-analysis==0.1.2
        ```
        
        Finally, to open the GUI from Python
        
        ```python
        import pupilanalysis.tkgui as gui
        gui.run()
        ```
        
        or from command line
        ```
        python -m pupilanalysis.tkgui
        ```
        
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        
        First, open your data directory. Next, select the regions of interest (ROIs) and then run measure movements.
        The ROIs and movements are saved on disk (<em>C:\Users\USER\PupilAnalysis</em> or <em>/home/USER/.pupilanalysis</em>), so these steps are needed only once per specimen.
        
        After the initial steps you, can perform further analyses in the program or
        export the data by copy-pasting to your favourite spread sheet or plotting program.
        
        
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        This is still an early development version (expect rough edges).
