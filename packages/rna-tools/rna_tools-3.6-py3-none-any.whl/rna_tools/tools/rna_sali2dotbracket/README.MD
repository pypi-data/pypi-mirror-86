This beauty here will go to sali notation and convert it to dotbracket notation.
On the folder there are two files:
IA1.sali is the test input. This is a file with the sequences and secondary structures of one group i intron family.
Run the script like this:
python rna_sali2dotbracket.py IA1.sali
On the screen the output will be displayed, which should look like IA1_dotbracket.txt
