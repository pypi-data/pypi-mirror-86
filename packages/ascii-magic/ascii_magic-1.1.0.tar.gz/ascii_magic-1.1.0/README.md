# ASCII Magic

Python package that converts images into ASCII art. Requires colorama and PIL.

## Basic usage

```python
import ascii_magic
output = ascii_magic.from_image_file('picture.jpg')
ascii_magic.to_terminal(output)
```

## Available functions

### from_image_file()

Converts an image file into ASCII art with terminal color codes.

```python
from_image_file(
    path: str,
    columns: int = 120,
    width_ratio: float = 2.5,
    char: str = None
) -> str
```

- path => a PIL-compatible file, such as picture.jpg
- columns (optional) => the number of characters per row, more columns = wider art
- pixel_width (optional) => ASCII characters are not square, so this adjusts the width to height ratio
- char (optional) => instead of using many different ASCII glyphs, you can use a single one, such as '#'

Example:

```python
from_image_file('images/1.jpg', columns=100, width_ratio=2.6, char='@')
```

### from_url()

As above, but using the URL of an image.

```python
from_url(
    url: str,
    # ... as above
) -> str
```

- url => an URL which will be loaded via urllib (supports redirects)

Example:

```python
img_url = 'https://source.unsplash.com/800x600?nature'
ascii_art = ascii_magic.from_url(img_url, columns=100)
```

### from_image()

As above, but using an image loaded with Pillow.

```python
from_image(
    img:Image,
    # ... as above
) -> str
```

- img => PIL image object

Example:

```python
from PIL import Image
with Image.open('images/1.jpg') as img:
    ascii_art = ascii_magic.from_image_file(img, columns=100)
```

### to_terminal()

Initializes colorama (which is required on Windows) and prints ASCII art to the terminal. It's the same as doing ```colorama.init()``` before printing normally.

```python
to_terminal(ascii_art:str) -> None
```
