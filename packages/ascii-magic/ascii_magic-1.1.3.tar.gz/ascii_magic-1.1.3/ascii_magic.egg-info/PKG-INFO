Description: # ASCII Magic
        
        Python package that converts images into ASCII art with terminal colors. Thanks to Colorama it's compatible with the Windows terminal. Code based on [ProfOak's Ascii Py](https://github.com/ProfOak/Ascii_py/).
        
        ![ASCII Magic example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeandroBarone/python-ascii_magic/master/example.png)
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        ```python
        import ascii_magic
        output = ascii_magic.from_image_file('picture.jpg')
        ascii_magic.to_terminal(output)
        ```
        
        ## Available functions
        
        ### from_image_file()
        
        Converts an image file into ASCII art with terminal color codes.
        
        ```python
        from_image_file(
            path: str,
            columns: int = 120,
            width_ratio: float = 2.5,
            char: str = None
        ) -> str
        ```
        
        - path => a PIL-compatible file, such as picture.jpg
        - columns (optional) => the number of characters per row, more columns = wider art
        - pixel_width (optional) => ASCII characters are not square, so this adjusts the width to height ratio
        - char (optional) => instead of using many different ASCII glyphs, you can use a single one, such as '#'
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from_image_file('images/1.jpg', columns=100, width_ratio=2.6, char='@')
        ```
        
        ### from_url()
        
        As above, but using the URL of an image.
        
        ```python
        from_url(
            url: str,
            # ... as above
        ) -> str
        ```
        
        - url => an URL which will be loaded via urllib (supports redirects)
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        img_url = 'https://source.unsplash.com/800x600?nature'
        ascii_art = ascii_magic.from_url(img_url, columns=100)
        ```
        
        ### from_image()
        
        As above, but using an image loaded with Pillow.
        
        ```python
        from_image(
            img: Image,
            # ... as above
        ) -> str
        ```
        
        - img => PIL image object
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from PIL import Image
        with Image.open('images/1.jpg') as img:
            ascii_art = ascii_magic.from_image(img, columns=100)
        ```
        
        ### to_terminal()
        
        Initializes Colorama (which is required on Windows) and prints ASCII art to the terminal. It's the same as doing ```colorama.init()``` before printing normally.
        
        ```python
        to_terminal(ascii_art: str) -> None
        ```
