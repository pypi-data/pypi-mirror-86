    The class attributes di, co, ir and hr represent Discrete Inputs, Coils, Input Registers and
    Holding Registers, respectively. Each attribute should be assigned a ModbusDataBank instance
    by the Interface implementation.

    Here, two basic ModbusDataBanks are created and initialized to a default value across the full
    range of valid addresses. One DataBank is shared by di and co, and the other by ir and hr to
    demonstrate overlaid memory segments. If you want each segment to have its own memory, just
    create separate instances for all four.
