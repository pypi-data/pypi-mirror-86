class DeviceBuilder:
    """
    This class takes a module object (for example imported via importlib.import_module or via the
    :class:`DeviceRegistry`) and inspects it so that it's possible to construct devices and
    interfaces.

    In order for the class to work properly, the device module has to adhere to a few rules.
    Device types, which means classes inheriting from :class:`DeviceBase`, are imported directly
    from the device module, equivalent to the following:

    .. sourcecode :: Python

        from device_name import SimulatedDeviceType

    If ``SimulatedDeviceType`` is defined in the ``__init__.py``, there's nothing else to do. If
    the device class is defined elsewhere, it must be imported in the ``__init__.py`` file as
    written above. If there is only one device type (which is probably the most common case), it is
    assumed to be default device type.

    Setups are discovered in two locations, the first one is a dict called ``setups`` in the device
    module, which must contain setup names as keys and as values again a dict. This inner dict has
    one mandatory key called ``device_type`` and one optional key ``parameters`` containing the
    constructor arguments for the specified device type:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        setups = dict(
            broken=dict(
                device_type=SimulatedDeviceType,
                parameters=dict(
                    override_initial_state='error',
                    override_initial_data=dict(
                        target=-10, position=-20.0))))

    The other location is a sub-package called `setups`, which should in turn contain modules. Each
    module must contain a variable ``device_type`` and a variable ``parameters`` which are
    analogous to the keys in the dict described above. This allows for more complex setups which
    define additional classes and so on.

    The ``default`` setup is special, it is used when no setup is supplied to
    :meth:`create_device`. If the setup ``default`` is not defined, one is created with the default
    device type. This has two consequences, no setups need to be defined for very simple devices,
    but if multiple device types are defined, a ``default`` setup must be defined.

    A setup can be supplied to the :meth:`create_device`.

    Lastly, the builder tries to discover device interfaces, which are currently classes based on
    :class:`lewis.adapters.InterfaceBase`. These are looked for in the module and in a sub-package
    called ``interfaces`` (which should contain modules with adapters like the ``setups`` package).

    Each interface has a protocol, if a protocol occurs more than once in a device module,
    a RuntimeError is raised.
