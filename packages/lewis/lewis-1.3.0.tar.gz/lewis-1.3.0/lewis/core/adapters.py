    Base class for adapters

    This class serves as a base class for concrete adapter implementations that expose a device via
    a certain communication protocol. It defines the minimal interface that an adapter must provide
    in order to fit seamlessly into other parts of the framework
    (most importantly :class:`~lewis.core.simulation.Simulation`).

    Sub-classes should re-define the ``protocol``-member to something appropriate. While it is
    explicitly supported to modify it in concrete device interface implementations, it is good
    to have a default (for example ``epics`` or ``stream``).

    An adapter should provide everything that is needed for the communication via the protocol it
    defines. This might involve constructing a server-object, configuring it and starting the
    service (this should happen in :meth:`start_server`). Due to the large differences between
    protocols it is very hard to provide general guidelines here. Please take a look at the
    implementations of existing adapters (:class:`~lewis.adapters.epics.EpicsAdapter`,
    :class:`~lewis.adapters.stream.StreamAdapter`),to get some examples.

    In principle, an adapter can exist on its own, but it only really becomes useful when a device
    is bound to it. To do this, assign an object derived from
    :class:`lewis.core.devices.DeviceBase` to the ``device``-property. Sub-classes have to
    implement :meth:`_bind_device` to achieve actual binding behavior.

    It is possible to pass a dictionary with configuration options to Adapter. The keys of
    the dictionary are accessible as properties of the ``_options``-member. Only keys that are
    in the ``default_options`` member of the class are accepted. Inheriting classes must override
    ``default_options`` to be a dictionary with the possible options for the adapter.

    Each adapter has a ``lock`` member, which contains a :class:`NoLock` by default. To make
    device access thread-safe, any adapter should acquire this lock before interacting with
    the device (or interface). This means that before starting the server component of an Adapter,
    a proper Lock-object needs to be assigned to ``lock``.
