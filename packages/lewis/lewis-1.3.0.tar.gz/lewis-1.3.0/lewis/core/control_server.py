class ExposedObject:
    """
    ExposedObject is a class that makes it easy to expose an object via the
    JSONRPCResponseManager from the json-rpc package, where it can serve as a dispatcher.
    For this purpose it exposes a read-only dict-like interface.

    The basic problem solved by this wrapper is that plain data members of an object are not
    really captured well by the RPC-approach, where a client performs function calls on a
    remote machine and gets the result back.

    The supplied object is inspected using dir(object) and all entries that do not start
    with a _ are exposed in a way that depends on whether the corresponding member
    is a method or a property (either in the Python-sense or the general OO-sense). Methods
    are stored directly, and stored in an internal dict where the method name is the key and
    the callable method object is the value. For properties, a getter- and a setter function
    are generated, which are then stored in the same dict. The names of these methods for
    a property called ``a`` are ``a:get`` and ``a:set``. The separator has been chosen to be
    colon because it can't be part of a valid Python identifier.

    If the second argument is not empty, it is interpreted to be the list of members
    to expose and only those are actually exposed. This can be used to explicitly expose
    members of an object that start with an underscore. If all but one or two members
    should be exposed, it's also possible to use the exclude-argument to explicitly
    exclude a few members. Both parameters can be used in combination, the exclude-list
    takes precedence.

    In certain situations it is desirable to acquire a lock before accessing the exposed object,
    for example when multiple threads are accessing it on the server side. For this purpose,
    the ``lock``-parameter can be used. If it is not ``None``, the exposed methods are wrapped
    in a function that acquires the lock before accessing ``obj``, and releases it afterwards.

    :param obj: The object to expose.
    :param members: This list of methods will be exposed. (defaults to all public members)
    :param exclude: Members in this list will not be exposed.
    :param exclude_inherited: Should inherited members be excluded? (defaults to False)
    :param lock: ``threading.Lock`` that is used when accessing ``obj``.
