that they can be caught and meaningful messages can be displayed to the user.

    from unexpected ones. This enables better error handling and more importantly
    better presentation of errors to the users.

    similar) is not allowed. An example is :class:`~lewis.adapters.epics.BoundPV` for enforcing
