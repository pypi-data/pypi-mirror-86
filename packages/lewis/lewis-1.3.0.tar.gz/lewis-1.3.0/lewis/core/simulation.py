class Simulation:
    """
    The Simulation class controls certain aspects of a device simulation,
    the most important one being time.

    Once :meth:`start` is called, the process-method of the device
    is called in regular intervals. The time between these calls is
    influenced by the cycle_delay property. Because of the way some
    network protocols work, the actual processing time can be
    longer or shorter, so cycle_delay should be seen as a guideline
    rather than a guaranteed parameter.

    In the simplest case, the actual time-delta between two cycles
    is passed to the simulated device so that it can update its internal
    state according to the elapsed time. It is however possible to set
    a simulation speed, which serves as a multiplier for this time.
    If the speed is set to 2 and 0.1 seconds pass between two cycles,
    the simulation is asked to simulate 0.2 seconds, and so on. Speed 0
    effectively stops all time dependent calculations in the
    simulated device.

    Another possibility to pause the simulation is the pause-method. After
    calling it, all processing in the device is suspended, while the communication
    adapters continue to work. This can be used to simulate that a device is "hanging".
    The simulation can be continued using the resume-method.

    A number of status properties provide information about the simulation.
    The total uptime (in actually elapsed time) can be obtained through the
    uptime-property, whereas the runtime-property contains the simulated time.
    The cycles-property indicates the total number of simulation cycles, which
    does not increase when the simulation is paused.

    Finally, the simulation can be stopped entirely with the stop-method.

    All functionality except for the start-method can be made available to remote
    computers via a :class:`ControlServer`-instance. The way to expose device and simulation
    is to pass a 'host:port'-string as the control_server argument,
    which will construct the control server. Simulation will try to start the
    control server using the start_server method.
