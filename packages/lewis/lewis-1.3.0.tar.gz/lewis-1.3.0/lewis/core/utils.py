class FromOptionalDependency:
    """
    This is a utility class for importing classes from a module or
    replacing them with dummy types if the module can not be loaded.

    Assume module 'a' that does:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        from b import C, D

    and module 'e' which does:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        from a import F

    where 'b' is a hard to install dependency which is thus optional.
    To still be able to do:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        import e

    without raising an error, for example for inspection purposes,
    this class can be used as a workaround in module 'a':

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        C, D = FromOptionalDependency('b').do_import('C', 'D')

    which is not as pretty as the actual syntax, but at least it
    can be read in a similar way. If the module 'b' can not be imported,
    stub-types are created that are called 'C' and 'D'. Everything depending
    on these types will work until any of those are instantiated - in that
    case an exception is raised.

    The exception can be controlled via the exception-parameter. If it is a
    string, a LewisException is constructed from it. Alternatively it can
    be an instance of an exception-type. If not provided, a LewisException
    with a standard message is constructed. If it is anything else, a RuntimeError
    is raised.

    Essentially, this class helps deferring ImportErrors until anything from
    the module that was attempted to load is actually used.

    :param module: Module from that symbols should be imported.
    :param exception: Text for LewisException or custom exception object.

class check_limits:
    """
    This decorator helps to make sure that the parameter of a property setter (or any other
    method with one argument) is within certain numerical limits.

    It's possible to set static limits using floats or ints:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class Foo:
            _bar = 0

            @property
            def bar(self):
                return self._bar

            @bar.setter
            @check_limits(0, 15)
            def bar(self, new_value):
                self._bar = new_value

    But sometimes this is not flexible enough, so it's also possible to supply strings, which
    are the names of attributes of the object the decorated method belongs with:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class Foo:
            _bar = 0

            bar_min = 0
            bar_max = 24

            @property
            def bar(self):
                return self._bar

            @bar.setter
            @check_limits('bar_min', 'bar_max')
            def bar(self, new_value):
                self._bar = new_value

    This will make sure that the new value is always between ``bar_min`` and ``bar_max``, even
    if they change at runtime. If the limit is ``None`` (default), the value will not be limited
    in that direction.

    Upper and lower limit can also be used exclusively, for example for a property that has a lower
    bound but not an upper, say a temperature:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class Foo:
            _temp = 273.15

            @check_limits(lower=0)
            def set_temperature(self, t_in_kelvin):
                self._temp = t_in_kelvin


    If the value is outside the specified limits, the decorated function is not called and a
    :class:`~lewis.core.exceptions.LimitViolationException` is raised if the ``silent``-
    parameter is ``False`` (default). If that option is active, the call is simply silently
    ignored.

    :param lower: Numerical lower limit or name of attribute that contains limit.
    :param upper: Numerical upper limit or name of attribute that contains limit.
    :param silent: A limit violation will not raise an exception if this option is ``True``.
    """

        self._upper = upper

            )

            if (lower is None or lower <= new_value) and (
