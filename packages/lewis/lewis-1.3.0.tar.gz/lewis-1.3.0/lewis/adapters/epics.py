class BoundPV:
    """
    Class to represent PVs that are bound to an adapter

    This class is very similar to :class:`~lewis.adapters.stream.Func`, in that
    it is the result of a binding operation between a user-specified :class:`PV`-object
    and a Device and/or Adapter object. Also, it should rarely be used directly. objects
    are generated automatically by :class:`EpicsAdapter`.

    The binding happens by supplying a ``target``-object which has an attribute or a property
    named according to the property-name stored in the PV-object, and a ``meta_target``-object
    which has an attribute named according to the meta_data_property in PV.

    The properties ``read_only``, ``config``,  and ``poll_interval`` simply forward the
    data of PV, while ``doc`` uses the target object to potentially obtain the property's
    docstring.

    To get and set the value of the property on the target, the ``value``-property of
    this class can be used, to get the meta data dict, there's a ``meta``-property.

    :param pv: PV object to bind to target and meta_target.
    :param target: Object that has an attribute named pv.property.
    :param meta_target: Object that has an attribute named pv.meta_data_property.

class PV:
    """
    The PV-class is used to declare the EPICS-interface exposed by a sub-class of
    EpicsAdapter. The ``target_property`` argument specifies which property of the adapter
    the PV maps to. To make development easier it can also be a part of the exposed
    device. If the property exists on both the Adapter-subclass and the device, the former
    has precedence. This is useful for overriding behavior for protocol specific "quirks".

    If the PV should be read only, this needs to be specified via
    the corresponding parameter. The information about the poll interval is used
    py EpicsAdapter to update the PV in regular intervals. All other named arguments
    are forwarded to the pcaspy server's `pvdb`, so it's possible to pass on
    limits, types, enum-values and so on.

    In case those arguments change at runtime, it's possible to provide ``meta_data_property``,
    which should contain the name of a property that returns a dict containing these values.
    For example if limits change:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class Interface(EpicsInterface):
            pvs = {
                'example': PV('example', meta_data_property='example_meta')
            }

            @property
            def example_meta(self):
                return {
                    'lolim': self.device._example_low_limit,
                    'hilim': self.device._example_high_limit,
                }

    The PV infos are then updated together with the value, determined by ``poll_interval``.

    In cases where the device is accessed via properties alone, this class provides the possibility
    to expose methods as PVs. A common use case would be to model a getter:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SomeDevice(Device):
            def get_example(self):
                return 42

        class Interface(EpicsInterface):
            pvs = {
                'example': PV('get_example')
            }

    It is also possible to model a getter/setter pair, in this case a tuple has to be provided:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SomeDevice(Device):
            _ex = 40

            def get_example(self):
                return self._ex + 2

            def set_example(self, new_example):
                self._ex = new_example - 2

        class Interface(EpicsInterface):
            pvs = {
                'example': PV(('get_example', 'set_example'))
            }

    Any of the two members in the tuple can be substituted with ``None`` in case it does not apply.
    Besides method names it is also allowed to provide callables. Valid callables are for example
    bound methods and free functions, but also lambda expressions and partials.

    There are however restrictions for the supplied functions (be it as method names or directly
    as callables) with respect to their signature. Getter functions must be callable without any
    arguments, setter functions must be callable with exactly one argument. The ``self`` of
    methods does not count towards this.


    :param target_property: Property or method name, getter function, tuple of getter/setter.
    :param poll_interval: Update interval of the PV.
    :param read_only: Should be True if the PV is read only. If not specified, the PV is
                      read_only if only a getter is supplied.
    :param meta_data_property: Property or method name, getter function, tuple of getter/setter.
    :param doc: Description of the PV. If not supplied, docstring of mapped property is used.
    :param kwargs: Arguments forwarded into pcaspy pvdb-dict.

class EpicsInterface(InterfaceBase):
    """
    Inheriting from this class provides an EPICS-interface to a device for use with
    :class:`EpicsAdapter`. In the simplest case all that is required is to inherit
    from this class and override the ``pvs``-member. It should be a dictionary
    that contains PV-names (without prefix) as keys and instances of PV as
    values. The prefix is handled by ``EpicsAdapter``.

    For a simple device with two properties, speed and position, the first of which
    should be read-only, it's enough to define the following:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SimpleDeviceEpicsInterface(EpicsInterface):
            pvs = {
                'VELO': PV('speed', read_only=True),
                'POS': PV('position', lolo=0, hihi=100)
            }

    For more complex behavior, the interface could contain properties that do not
    exist in the device itself. If the device should also have a PV called STOP
    that "stops the device", the interface could look like this:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SimpleDeviceEpicsInterface(EpicsInterface):
            pvs = {
                'VELO': PV('speed', read_only=True),
                'POS': PV('position', lolo=0, hihi=100),
                'STOP': PV('stop', type='int'),
            }

            @property
            def stop(self):
                return 0

            @stop.setter
            def stop(self, value):
                if value == 1:
                    self.device.halt()

    Even though the device does *not* have a property called ``stop`` (but a method called
    ``halt``), issuing the command

    ::

        $ caput STOP 1

    will achieve the desired behavior, because ``EpicsInterface`` merges the properties
    of the device into ``SimpleDeviceEpicsInterface`` itself, so that it is does not
    matter whether the specified property in PV exists in the device or the adapter.

    The intention of this design is to keep device classes small and free of
    protocol specific stuff, such as in the case above where stopping a device
    via EPICS might involve writing a value to a PV, whereas other protocols may
    offer an RPC-way of achieving the same thing.

        In the transformation process, the method tries to find whether the attribute specified by
        PV's ``property`` (and ``meta_data_property``) is part of the internally stored device
