    ESS chopper EPICS interface

    Interaction with this interface should happen via ChannelAccess (CA). The PV-names
    usually carry a prefix which depends on the concrete device and environment, so
    it is omitted in this description. The dynamically generated description of the PVs
    does however contain the prefix so that the names can be copy-pasted easily.

    The first step is to initialize the chopper, for example via caput on the command line:

        $ caput CmdS init

    After this, the chopper is in a state where it can be started:

        $ caget State
        State                          stopped

    To set a specific speed and phase, the setpoints have to be configured via caput:

        $ caput Spd 100
        $ caput Phs 34.5

    Then the chopper can be commanded to move towards those values:

        $ caput CmdS start

    Now the disc accelerates to the setpoints, the state should now be different:

        $ caget State
        State                          accelerating

    The possible commands are part of the PV-specific documentation.
