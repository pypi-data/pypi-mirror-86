    This class exists mainly for consistency. It is meant to implement very simple devices that
    do not require a state machine for their simulation. For such devices, all that is required
    is subclassing from `Device` and possibly implementing `doProcess`, but this is optional.

    StateMachineDevice offers more functionality and is more likely to be useful for implementing
    simulations of real devices.

class StateMachineDevice(DeviceBase, CanProcessComposite):
    """
    This class is intended to be sub-classed to implement devices using a finite state machine
    internally.

    Implementing such a device is straightforward, there are three methods
    that *must* be overridden:

        - :meth:`_get_state_handlers`
        - :meth:`_get_initial_state`
        - :meth:`_get_transition_handlers`

    The first method is supposed to return a dictionary with state handlers for each state
    of the state machine, the second method must return the name of the initial state.
    The third method must return a dict-like object (often an OrderedDict from collections)
    that defines the conditions for transitions between the states of the state machine.

    They are implemented as methods and not as plain class member variables, because often
    they use the `self`-variable, which does not exist at the class level.

    From these three methods, a :class:`~lewis.core.statemachine.StateMachine`-instance is
    constructed, it's available as the device's ``_csm``-member. CSM is short for
    "cycle-based state machine".

    Most device implementation will also want to override this method:

        - :meth:`_initialize_data`

    This method should initialise device state variables (such as temperature, speed, etc.).
    Having this in a separate method from ``__init__`` has the advantage that it can be used
    to reset those variables at a later stage, without having to write the same code again.

    Following this scheme, inheriting from StateMachineDevice also provides the possibility
    for users of the class to override the states, the transitions, the initial state and
    even the data. For states, transitions and data, dicts need to be passed to the
    constructor, for the initial state that should be a string.

    All these overrides can be used to define device setups to describe certain scenarios
    more easily.

    :param override_states: Dict with one entry per state. Only states defined in the state
                            machine are allowed.
    :param override_transitions: Dict with (state, state) tuples as keys and
                                 callables as values.
    :param override_initial_state: The initial state.
    :param override_initial_data: A dict that contains data members
                                  that should be overwritten on construction.
