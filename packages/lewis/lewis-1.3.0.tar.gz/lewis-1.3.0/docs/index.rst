Welcome to the LeWIS documentation!
===================================

Lewis is a Python package that makes it easy to develop complex stateful device simulations. It
is licensed under GPL version 3 and the source is available on github_, where you are welcome to
open new issues so the package can improve.

If you're new to Lewis reading the :doc:`user_guide/index` is a good start. Once you plan
on writing your own device it's time to go through the :doc:`developer_guide/index`.
The :doc:`api/index` can also help with that.
