    A very simple device with TCP-stream interface

    The device has only one parameter, which can be set to an arbitrary
    value. The interface consists of five commands which can be invoked via telnet.
    To connect:

        $ telnet host port

    After that, typing either of the commands and pressing enter sends them to the server.

    The commands are:

     - ``V``: Returns the parameter as part of a verbose message.
     - ``V=something``: Sets the parameter to ``something``.
     - ``P``: Returns the device parameter unmodified.
     - ``P=something``: Exactly the same as ``V=something``.
     - ``R`` or ``r``: Returns the number 4.
