    A simple device where commands are terminated by a timeout.

    This demonstrates how to implement devices that do not have standard
    terminators and where a command is considered terminated after a certain
    time delay of not receiving more data.

    To interact with this device, you must switch telnet into char mode, or use
    netcat with special tty settings:

        $ telnet host port
        ^]
        telnet> mode char
        [type command and wait]

        $ stty -icanon && nc host port
        hello world!
        foobar!

    The following commands are available:

     - ``hello ``: Reply with "world!"
     - ``foo``: Replay with "bar!"
     - ``P``: Returns the device parameter
     - ``P=something``: Set parameter to specified value

    """

    commands = {
        # Space as \x20 represents a custom 'terminator' for this command only
        # However, waiting for the timeout still applies
        Cmd("say_world", pattern=scanf("hello\x20")),
        Cmd("say_bar", pattern=scanf("foo")),
        Var("param", read_pattern=scanf("P"), write_pattern=scanf("P=%d")),
    }

    # An empty in_terminator triggers "timeout mode"
    # Otherwise, a ReadTimeout is considered an error.
    in_terminator = ""
    out_terminator = "\r\n"

    # Unusually long, for easier manual entry
