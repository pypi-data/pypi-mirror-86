The statemachine module contains one of lewis' central parts, the cycle-based
:class:`StateMachine`. The module also contains classes that make it easier to define the
state machine (:class:`State`, :class:`Transition`). Despite its central nature, it's unlikely
to be used directly in client code for device simulations - these should be based on
:class:`StateMachineDevice`, which provides a more convenient interface for that purpose.
