"""
This module defines two classes related to one of lewis' essential concepts, namely
the cycle-based approach. :class:`CanProcess` and :class:`CanProcessComposite` implement the
composite design pattern so that it's possible to form a tree of objects which can perform
calculations based on an elapsed time Î”t.
"""


class CanProcess:
    """
    The CanProcess class is meant as a base for all things that
    are able to process on the basis of a time delta (dt).

    The base implementation does nothing.

    There are three methods that can be implemented by sub-classes and are called in the
    process-method in this order:

        1. doBeforeProcess
        2. doProcess
        3. doAfterProcess

    The doBefore- and doAfterProcess methods are only called if a doProcess-method exists.

    This subclass of CanProcess is a convenient way of collecting
    multiple items that implement the CanProcess interface.

    Items can be added to the composite like this:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        composite = CanProcessComposite()
        composite.add_processor(item_that_implements_CanProcess)

    The process-method calls the process-method of each contained
    item. Specific things that have to be done before or after the
    containing items are processed can be implemented in the doBefore-
    and doAfterProcess methods.
