class Func:
    """
    Objects of this type connect a callable object to a pattern matcher (:class:`PatternMatcher`),
    which currently comprises :class:`regex` and :class:`scanf`. Strings are also
    accepted, they are treated like a regular expression internally. This preserves default
    behavior from older versions of Lewis.

    In general, Func-objects should not be created directly, instead they are created by one of
    the sub-classes of :class:`CommandBase` using :meth:`~CommandBase.bind`.

    Function arguments are indicated by groups in the regular expression. The number of
    groups has to match the number of arguments of the function. In earlier versions of Lewis it
    was possible to pass flags to ``re.compile``, this has been removed for consistency issues
    in :class:`Var`. It is however still possible to use the exact same flags as part of the
    regular expression. In the documentation of re_, this is outlined, simply add a group to the
    expression that contains the flags, for example ``(?i)`` to make the expression case
    insensitive. This special group does not count towards the matching groups used for argument
    capture.

    The optional argument_mappings can be an iterable of callables with one parameter of the
    same length as the number of arguments of the function. The first parameter will be
    transformed using the first function, the second using the second function and so on.
    This can be useful to automatically transform strings provided by the adapter into a proper
    data type such as ``int`` or ``float`` before they are passed to the function. In case the
    pattern is of type :class:`scanf`, this is optional (but will override the mappings
    provided by the matcher).

    The return_mapping argument is similar, it should map the return value of the function
    to a string. The default map function only does that when the supplied value
    is not None. It can also be set to a numeric value or a string constant so that the
    command always returns the same value. If it is ``None``, the return value is not
    modified at all.

    Finally, documentation can be provided by passing the doc-argument. If it is omitted,
    the docstring of the bound function is used and if that is not present, left empty.

class CommandBase:
    """
    This is the common base class of :class:`Cmd` and :class:`Var`. The concept of commands for
    the stream adapter is based on connecting a callable object to a pattern that matches an
    inbound request.

    The type of pattern can be either an implementation of :class:`PatternMatcher`
    (regex or scanf format specification) or a plain string (which is treated as a regular
    expression).

    For free function and lambda expressions this is straightforward: the function object can
    simply be stored together with the pattern. Most often however, the callable
    is a method of the device or interface object - these do not exist when the commands are
    defined.

    This problem is solved by introducing a "bind"-step in :class:`StreamAdapter`. So instead
    of a function object, both :class:`Cmd` and :class:`Var` store the name of a member of device
    or interface. At "bind-time", this is translated into the correct callable.

    So instead of using :class:`Cmd` or :class:`Var` directly, both classes' :meth:`bind`-methods
    return an iterable of :class:`Func`-objects which can be used for processing requests.
    :class:`StreamAdapter` performs this bind-step when it's constructed. For details regarding
    the implementations, please see the corresponding classes.

    .. seealso::

        Please take a look at :class:`Cmd` for exposing callable objects or methods of
        device/interface and :class:`Var` for exposing attributes and properties.

class Var(CommandBase):
    r"""
    With this implementation of :class:`CommandBase` it's possible to expose plain data attributes
    or properties of device or interface. Getting and setting a value are separate procedures
    which both have their own pattern, read_pattern and write_pattern to match a command each.
    Please note that write_pattern has to have exactly one group defined to match a parameter.

    Due to this separation, parameters can be made read-only, write-only or read-write in the
    interface:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SomeInterface(StreamInterface):
            commands = {
                Var('foo', read_pattern='^F$', write_pattern=r'^F=(\d+)$',
                    argument_mappings=(int,), doc='An integer attribute.'),
                Var('bar' read_pattern='^B$')
            }

            foo = 10

            @property
            def bar(self):
                return self.foo + 5

            @bar.setter
            def bar(self, new_bar):
                self.foo = new_bar - 5

    In the above example, the foo attribute can be read and written, it's automatically converted
    to an integer, while bar is a property that can only be read via the stream protocol.

class StreamInterface(InterfaceBase):
    r"""
    This class is used to provide a TCP-stream based interface to a device.

    Many hardware devices use a protocol that is based on exchanging text with a client via
    a TCP stream. Sometimes RS232-based devices are also exposed this way via an adapter-box.
    This adapter makes it easy to mimic such a protocol.

    This class has the following attributes which may be overridden by subclasses:

     - protocol: What this interface is called for purposes of the -p commandline option.
       Defaults to "stream".
     - in_terminator, out_terminator: These define how lines are terminated when transferred
       to and from the device respectively. They are stripped/added automatically.
       Inverse of protocol file InTerminator and OutTerminator. The default is ``\\r``.
     - readtimeout: How many msec to wait for additional data between packets, once transmission
       of an incoming command has begun. Inverse of ReadTimeout in protocol files.
       Defaults to 100 (ms). Set to 0 to disable timeout completely.
     - commands: A list of :class:`~CommandBase`-objects that define mappings between protocol
       and device/interface methods/attributes.

    By default, commands are expressed as regular expressions, a simple example may look like this:

    .. sourcecode:: Python

        class SimpleDeviceStreamInterface(StreamInterface):
            commands = [
                Cmd('set_speed', r'^S=([0-9]+)$', argument_mappings=[int]),
                Cmd('get_speed', r'^S\?$')
                Var('speed', read_pattern=r'^V\?$', write_pattern=r'^V=([0-9]+)$')
            ]

            def set_speed(self, new_speed):
                self.device.speed = new_speed

            def get_speed(self):
                return self.device.speed

    The interface has two commands, ``S?`` to return the speed and ``S=10`` to set the speed
    to an integer value. It also exposes the same speed attribute as a variable, using auto-
    generated ``V?`` and ``V=10`` commands.

    As in the :class:`lewis.adapters.epics.EpicsInterface`, it does not matter whether the
    wrapped method is a part of the device or of the interface, this is handled automatically when
    a new device is assigned to the ``device``-property.

    In addition, the :meth:`handle_error`-method can be overridden. It is called when an exception
    is raised while handling commands.
