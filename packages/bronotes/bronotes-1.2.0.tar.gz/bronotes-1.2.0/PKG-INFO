Description: # Bronotes
        
        Basically a wrapper to access notes in a directory on your system anywhere from the commandline.
        Still in development but the basic functionality is there.
        
        Functionality so far:
          * Create a note directory on your system on first start
          * Add new notes
          * Remove notes
          * Move notes and directories around
          * Edit notes with your $EDITOR
          * List notes dir in a tree
        
        ## Todo
        
          * Add something to keep folder in sync with git
        
        ## Installation and usage
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install bronotes
        
        $ bnote -h 
        usage: bnote [-h] {add,rm,list,edit,mv,set,completions} ...
        
        positional arguments:
          {add,rm,list,edit,mv,set,completions}
                                Bronote actions.
            add                 Add a note or directory.
            rm                  Delete a note or directory.
            list                Show the notes structure as a tree.
            edit                Edit a note.
            mv                  Move a note or directory.
            set                 Set config options.
            completions         Generate zsh autocompletions.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
        $ bnote -h
        usage: bnote [-h] {add,rm,list,edit,mv,set} ...
        ```
        
        On first command a folder to be used is asked.
        
        ### Completions
        
        For now there's no built-in completions.
        ZSH completions can be generated so you can place them where needed:
        ```bash
        $ bnote completions | tee /home/jwiersma/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_BRONOTES
        ```
