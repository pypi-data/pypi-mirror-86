A **magical** AMQP 0.9.1  client, that uses **heavy sorcery** to achieve speeds that other pure-Python AMQP clients cannot even hope to match.
Additionally, it's traceable using **opentracing**.

Documentation (WIP) is available at [Read the Docs](http://coolamqp.readthedocs.io/).

CoolAMQP uses [semantic versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

tl;dr - [this](coolamqp/framing/definitions.py) is **machine-generated** compile-time.
[this](coolamqp/framing/compilation/content_property.py) **generates classes run-time**,
and there are memoryviews **_everywhere_**. 

This is borderline absurd.

CoolAMQP is not a direct AMQP client - it also handles reconnections, transactional sending,
and so on, mostly via Futures. This means it has a certain opinion on how to 
handle AMQP, but you can feel the spirit of AMQP underneath. *API is stable*.


The project is actively maintained and used in a commercial project. Tests can run
either on Vagrant (Vagrantfile attached) or Travis CI, and run against RabbitMQ.

CoolAMQP won't touch your messages. It's your bags o'bytes, and your properties.

Enjoy!

_Watch out for memoryviews!_ They're here to stay.

## Notes
Assertions are sprinkled throughout the code. You may wish to run with optimizations enabled
if you need every CPU cycle you can get.

Note that if you define the environment variable of `COOLAMQP_FORCE_SELECT_LISTENER`, 
CoolAMQP will use select-based networking instead of epoll based.

## Current limitations

* channel flow mechanism is not supported (#11)
* _confirm=True_ is not available if you're not RabbitMQ (#8)


## Copyright holder change

Since SMOK sp. z o.o. was incorporated, it inherited all SMOK-related
IP of previous operator of the service, DMS Serwis s.c., which
continues to operate within it's designated company agreement.
From there stems the copyright holder name change.

## What is here

### [coolamqp](coolamqp/)

The core module

### [stress_tests](stress_tests/)

A series of stress tests to catch any race conditions

### [tests](tests/)

A series of unit tests that need an AMQP server listening.

### [compile_definitions](compile_definitions/)

A tool to generate [definitions.py](coolamqp/framing/definitions.py)
from [amqp-0-9-1.xml](resources/amqp0-9-1.xml)

In order to compile the definitions:

* Make sure that you have `yapf` installed
* then perform:
  ```python
  python -m compile_definitions
  ```
and you're all set. The only files modified is
[definitions.py](coolamqp/framing/definitions.py).

### [resources](resources/)

A downloaded from OASIS machine-readable AMQP 0.9.1 specification.

### [docs](docs/)

Sources for the documentation, available
[here](https://coolamqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Running unit tests

Unit tests are powered by nose. They require an available AMQP broker.
If you host the broker other than localhost, set the env *AMQP_HOST* to correct value.
The default username used is guest, and password is guest.

You can also run unit tests from Docker, if you wish so. To launch the unit test suite:

```bash
docker-compose up unittest
```

To launch the stress test suite

```bash
docker-compose up stress_tests
```
