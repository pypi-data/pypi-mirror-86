"""
Comprehensive management of a framing connection.

Connection is something that can:
 - call something when an AMQPFrame is received
 - send AMQPFrame's

 Pretty much CoolAMQP is about persistent "attaches" that attach to transient connection
 (they die when down) to do stuff, ie. send messages, consume, etc.
