"""

Core object here is Connection. This package:
    - establishes basic connectivity (up to the point where you can open channels yourself)
    - takes care of heartbeats

You can wait for a particular frame by setting watches on connections.
Watches will fire upon an event triggering them.

EVERYTHING HERE IS CALLED BY LISTENER THREAD UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE.
