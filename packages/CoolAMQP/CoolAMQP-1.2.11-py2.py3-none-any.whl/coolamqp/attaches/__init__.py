"""
Attaches are components that attach to an coolamqp.uplink.Connection and perform some duties
These duties almost always require allocating a channel. A base class - Channeler - is provided to faciliate that.
The attache becomes then responsible for closing this channel.

Attache should also register at least one on_fail watch, so it can handle things if they go south.

Multiple attaches can be "abstracted" as single one via AttacheGroup (which is also an Attache)

EVERYTHING HERE IS CALLED BY LISTENER THREAD UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE.
