        ## About
        
        Starfish is an open-sourced developer toolkit for the data economy. Available in flavours of Java, Python, and Clojure, it allows developers, data scientists and enterprises to create, interact, integrate and manage a data supply line through standardised and simple-to-use APIs.
        
        Based on an underlying data ecosystem standard, Starfish provides high-level APIs for common tasks within the data economy, for example, registering/publishing an asset, for subsequent use in a data supply line. In this case, an asset can be any data set, model or data service. The high-level API also allows developers to invoke operation on an asset, e.g. computing a predictive model or anonymising sensitive personal information, among other capabilities.
        
        Starfish works with blockchain networks, such as Ocean Protocol, and common web services through agents, allowing unprecedented flexibility in asset discovery and data supply line management.
        
        Starfish-py provides user access and tools to work with the Ocean Protocol Network, delegating certain functions via the python library squid-py.
        
        While we strive to deliver code at a high quality, please note, that there exist parts of the library that still need thorough testing.
        Contributions – whether it is in the form of new features, better documentation or tests – are welcome.
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Python >= 3.6
        
        ## Development
        
        1. Clone this repo
        
            ```bash
            clone https://github.com/DEX-Company/starfish-py.git
            cd starfish-py
            ```
        
        1. Set up a virtual environment
        
            ```bash
            virtualenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        
        1. Install package requirements for starfish
        
            ```bash
            make install
            ```
        
        1. Run the unit tests, without any supporting software/libraries outside of starfish
        
            ```bash
            make test_unit
            ```
        
        1. Create the local testing environment using [dex-chain](https://github.com/DEX-Company/dex-chain).
        
            In a seperate terminal session you need to clone and checkout ```dex-chain``` repository, by doing the following:
            ```
            git clone https://github.com/DEX-Company/dex-chain.git
            cd dex-chain
            ./start_dex_chain.sh test
            ```
        
        1. Run the integration tests
        
            ```
            pytest tests/integration
            ```
        
        1. Run the all tests
        
            ```bash
            make tests
            ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        1. Build Sphinx documentation
        
            To build the Syphinx auto documentation, you need to do the following:
            ```bash
            make docs
            ```
        
        The [documentation](https://dex-company.github.io/starfish-py) for this repo.
        
        
        ## Testing
        
        Automatic tests are setup via github actions.
        Our test use pytest framework.
        The testing uses a dex-chain docker image and surfer server.
        See [github actions for testing](https://github.com/DEX-Company/starfish-py/blob/master/.github/workflows/testing.yml)
        
        ## New Version
        
        The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
        
        ## Mailing Lists
