"""Utilities which wrap adviser's and dependency monkey's and run them in a subprocess.

This is useful for a cluster deployment where we restrict resources allocated for an adviser or dependency monkey run.
Annealing is run as a subprocess to the main process - if resources are exhausted (CPU time or memory allocated), the
subprocess is killed (either by liveness probe or by OOM killer) and the main process can still produce an
error message.
