Introduction to Thoth's adviser principles
------------------------------------------

In the upcoming section you can find discussion and intuition behind Thoth's
adviser logic and nomenclature used in Thoth repositories, sources and
documentation.

Intuition behind Thoth's recommendations
========================================

Let's consider an application that has two dependencies - a package called
``simplelib`` and ``anotherlib``. These dependencies can be installed in
different versions and do not require any additional packages to be installed.
Let's have a function that scores an application based on "how good it is" when
different versions of ``simplelib`` and ``anotherlib`` are used. The semantics
for "how good" can be different, but one can imagine scoring based on
performance, security vulnerabilities present and/or application misbehaviour
(or any other scoring you can come up with).

If we create all the combinations of ``simplelib`` and ``anotherlib`` that can
be produced and we score these combinations using our scoring function we get a
discrete results as shown on the following figure:

.. image:: _static/state_space.png
   :target: _static/state_space.png
   :alt: A discrete state space with with results of the scoring function.

By interpolating these values we get a surface as shown on the next figure, this
visualization is also more intuitive:

.. image:: _static/state_space_interpolated.png
   :target: _static/state_space_interpolated.png
   :alt: Interpolated discrete values in the state space forming a surface.

As can be seen, we get different score based on different versions of
``simplelib`` and ``anotherlib`` combinations. Thoth's adviser, when computing
recommendations, tries to find the highest values of the scoring function - the
highest spikes present (assuming the higher number of score, the better
software stack is).

   :target: _static/state_space_spikes.png
   :alt: Spikes present in the state space.

Thoth's :ref:`resolver <resolver>` can produce all the combinations of packages,
considering Python ecosystem resolution, and can be guided using
:ref:`predictor <predictor>` to find high values of score faster:

.. image:: _static/state_space_guided.png
   :target: _static/state_space_guided.png
   :alt: Guiding resolver using predictor to resolver higher rated scores faster.

Considering real-world applications, software stacks can be formed out of
multiple packages coming in different versions. Packages are introduced into a
software stack based on dependency requirements of direct or indirect
dependencies that can be restricted using version range specifications (making
some of the combinations invalid). The shown 3D figures above show scoring
function for two different packages in a software stack. This scoring function
can be generalized to n-dimensional space when a software stack is made out of
n-1 packages (at most) and n-th dimension is always result of the scoring
function used.

Thoth's :ref:`resolver <resolver>` approach of resolving software stacks is
to expand dependency graphs (lazily), instead of directly implementing
`3SAT problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem>`_
as in case of other resolvers. See :ref:`resolver <resolver>` documentation
for more info.

.. _introduction_rl:

Prediction-based resolution using reinforcement learning
========================================================

As stated above, Thoth's adviser does not implement `3SAT problem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem>`_ as many
resolvers do. Instead, the whole resolution is seen as a `Markov Decision
Process (MDP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process>`_.
Intuitively, any (not necessary fully resolved) software stack can be
seen as a state in an MDP and satisfies Markov property:

  Any future resolution of resolver's state depends only upon the present
  state, not on the sequence of events (resolution of dependencies) that
  preceded it.

A fully resolved software stack that satisfy all the requirements of all the
dependencies present in the software stack then represents a terminal state in
an MDP. Finding the best possible software stack (a terminal state with the
highest score) then corresponds to solving the given MDP.

The whole design of adviser's resolution can be seen as a framework for
writing predictors for prediction based resolution.

More formally:

* let *S* be a finite set of states in which the resolution can be in -
  partially but also fully resolved software stacks

* let *A* be a finite set of actions, *A*\ :sub:`s`\  be a finite state of
  actions from a state *s*

* let *R*\ :sub:`a`\ *(s, s')* be expected immediate reward received after
  transitioning from state *s* to state *s'* by taking action *a* following
  some policy Ï€.

.. note::

  The state space as described and shown in the previous section corresponds to
  the score in a terminal state (cumulative score) - when both libraries
  ``simplelib`` and ``anotherlib`` are resolved and present in fully pinned
  down software stacks and there are no more unresolved dependencies (no more
  requirements introduced by resolving these two libraries).

  In otherwords, the function plotted corresponds to `Bellman equation
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation>`_ for all terminal states
  following a policy during resolution.

Each entry in the state transition function in the MDP corresponds to a
step that is performed by resolver, by taking an unresolved dependency
and resolving it.

Pipeline units called :ref:`steps <steps>` then act like a critic that scores
the given action taken (compute immediate reward signal).

For a more illustrative example, let's suppose that the resolver is taking an
action in some state s\ :sub:`n`\. Let this state be described by unresolved,
resolved dependencies and its current score (based on Bellman equation).

*Resolved dependencies:*

* ``flask==1.1.1``

*Unresolved dependencies:*

* ``click==6.7``
* ``click==7.0``
* ``itsdangerous==1.1.0``
* ``jinja2==2.10.2``
* ``jinja2==2.10.3``
* ``werkzeug==0.15.1``

*Score:* 0.5

.. image:: _static/mdp.png
   :target: _static/mdp.png
   :alt: An illustrative MDP described in the text.
   :align: center

We resolve an unresolved dependency - let's say we take action s\ :sub:`n` a\
:sub:`2` and resolve ``itsdangerous==1.1.0``, we retrieve an immediate reward
0.33 and we end up in state s\ :sub:`n + 3`\. This action is scored by all
pipeline units of type :ref:`step <steps>` - a sum of their scores - note that
this transition can be also invalidated by any of the step pipeline unit present
in the current pipeline configuration.

The new state created is described as follows:

*Resolved dependencies:*

* ``flask==1.1.1``
* ``itsdangerous==1.1.0``

*Unresolved dependencies:*

* ``click==6.7``
* ``click==7.0``
* ``jinja2==2.10.2``
* ``jinja2==2.10.3``
* ``werkzeug==0.15.1``
* \+ all the direct dependencies of ``itsdangerous==1.1.0`` respecting
  their version range specification.

*Score:* 0.83

Direct dependencies of ``itsdangerous==1.1.0`` added to unresolved dependencies
are filtered based on :ref:`sieve pipeline units <sieves>` present in the current
pipeline configuration. Note that sieves can make the given transition invalid if
they remove all versions for a specific package. As an example, let's say
``itsdangerous==1.1.0`` depends on ``daiquiri`` in versions ``1.0``, ``2.0`` or
``3.0``. If pipeline sieves remove all the versions of ``daiquiri``, dependency
sub-graph of ``itsdangerous==1.1.0`` cannot be satisfied - hence the action
s\ :sub:`n` a\ :sub:`2` is invalid.

.. note::

  If there would be any other version of ``itsdangerous`` in the unresolved
  dependencies listing, it would be removed (as well as its whole dependency
  sub-graph) as package of type ``itsdangerous`` is already present in the
  current state respecting requirements.

As can be seen, the main role of sieves is to filter out invalid future actions in
the upcoming resolver rounds, without considering any possible state the resolver
could end up with (state independent filtering).

.. note::

  If the given action from a state leads to invalid transition, the predictor
  instance receives reward signal equal to ``math.nan``.

If a valid transition leads to a state that has no unresolved dependencies,
the given state is final (terminal state in case of MDP terminology) and it
represents a fully pinned down software stack.

.. note::

  If the given action from a state leads to a final state (*terminal state*), the
  predictor instance receives a reward signal equal to ``math.inf``.
