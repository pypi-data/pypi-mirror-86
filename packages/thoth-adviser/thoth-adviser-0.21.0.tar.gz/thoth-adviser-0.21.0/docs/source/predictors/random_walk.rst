.. _random_walk:

Random walk based dependency graph sampling
-------------------------------------------

This predictor implements sampling of a dependency graph based on `Random walk
method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk>`_. You can see this method
as a random rays into dependency graph that resolve final states (fully pinned
down software stacks). :class:`The implementation
<thoth.adviser.predictors.RandomWalk>` is easy to understand when implementing
other predictors.

It's mostly suitable when dealing with `cold start problem
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(computing)>`_.

An example of using this predictor can be `seen in this YouTube video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3hFn8KRsKc>`__ or `this blog post
<https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-beat-pythons-pip-dependency-monkey-inspecting-the-quality-of-tensorflow-dependencies-2503bed30450>`__.
A summary of results can be seen in `this article
<https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/30/ai-software-stack-inspection-with-thoth-and-tensorflow/?sc_cid=7013a000002gbzfAAA>`__.

The predictor is suitable for sampling the state space of all the possible
software stacks to obtain a relevant dataset which could be further analyzed.
Once any issues or inspected aspects of software stacks are spotted, other
predictors could be used to narrow down to a issue maker (such as :ref:`package
combinations predictor <package_combinations>`).

The figure bellow shows random walk performed during resolution of a
software stack in a state space with random score assigned to packages. x-axis
shows resolver iterations and y-axis corresponds to scores computed. As can be
seen, the predictor does not learn state space characteristics to resolve
software stacks and randomly comes up with software stacks.
