Description: # SCAD2D - Static Code Analysis for SCAD
        
        ![](identity/SCA2D.png)
        
        This is an experimental linter for OpenSCAD. The focus is to properly lex the `.scad` files so that we can test for dangerous code like redefining variable from other scopes. SCA2D is in a very early stage of development.
        
        ## How to run
        
        Once installed you should be able to run SCA2D from the terminal. To see the help screen run:
        
            sca2d -h
        
        To analysyse a `.scad` file run:
        
            sca2d filename.scad
        This will print the any code messages to the screen.
        
        If you wish to inspect the parse tree that SCA2D generates and then uses you can instead run:
        
            scad2d --output-tree filename.scad
        the tree will be printed into a file called `output.sca2d`.
        
        ## What works
        
        * Parsing most `.scad` files. We don't yet to extensive testing. Please raise an issue if you find a parsing error in SCA2D.
        * Parsing included and used `.scad` files and checking variable, function, and module usage in different scopes.
        * Checking for a minimal number of code errors
        
        ## What needs work
        
        * The searching for which files to include is very *ad-hoc* and will fail on all but the most simple examples.
        * If a file is missing SCA2D does not handle this gracefully.
        * Need to decide a useful set of conventions and rules to check for.
        * Messages need to be defined in a separate file rather than included *ad-hoc* into the code.
        * The messaging system is not customisable yet.
        * Need to build up a decent set of tests examples, to test that the analysis is working correctly.
        
        ## How to get involved
        
        The best way to get involved is to find bugs and open and issue. You could also make changes and open a MR, but the code is a little unstructured right now so it may be worth dicussing changes in an issue thread first.
