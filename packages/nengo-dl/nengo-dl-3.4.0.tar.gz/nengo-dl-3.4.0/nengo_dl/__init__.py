You are running Python version %s with NengoDL version %s. NengoDL requires
at least Python 3.5.

The fact that this version was installed on your system probably means that you
are using an older version of pip; you should consider upgrading with

 $ pip install pip setuptools --upgrade

There are two options for getting NengoDL working:

- Upgrade to Python >= 3.5

- Install an older version of NengoDL:

 $ pip install 'nengo-dl<2.0'
