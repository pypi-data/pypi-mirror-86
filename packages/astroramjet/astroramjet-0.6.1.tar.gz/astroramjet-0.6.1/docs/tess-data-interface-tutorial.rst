Simple TESS data interface tutorial
===================================

Tutorial Summary
----------------

This tutorial shows how to use several convenience functions in the :code:`ramjet` package to quickly download,
view, and find additional information about `TESS <https://tess.mit.edu>`_ lightcurves. For the time being, this is only
for 2-minute cadence TESS lightcurves.

Setup
-----
All that's needed for this tutorial is to install the :code:`ramjet` pip package using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astroramjet

All the functions below are methods of the :code:`TessDataInterface` class. So we need to create an instance of this
class to use the rest of the commands. Either from a Python console, or in a Python script, create the instance object
using:

.. code-block:: python

    from ramjet.data_interface.tess_data_interface import TessDataInterface
    tess_data_interface = TessDataInterface()

Download a TESS lightcurve
--------------------------
To download a lightcurve, use a command like:

.. code-block:: python

    tess_data_interface.download_two_minute_cadence_lightcurve(tic_id=370101492, sector=12, save_directory='lightcurves')

This will create a directory called "lightcurves" in the current working directory (if it doesn't exist), and download
into it the lightcurve FITS file for TIC 370101492 in sector 12.

Plot a lightcurve from MAST
---------------------------
This provides a single line to plot a lightcurve from MAST for quick viewing (this also performs the download).

.. code-block:: python

    tess_data_interface.plot_lightcurve_from_mast(tic_id=370101492, sector=12)

This will generate an interactive Matplotlib window plotting the lightcurve.

.. image:: tess-data-interface-tutorial/plot-from-mast-example.png

The lightcurve is downloaded to a temporary directory, so you don't need to worry about cleanup. You can also pass
:code:`base_data_point_size=10` to increase the point plotting size (10 can be swapped with any size). This helps when
zooming into a view that will have much less data points.

Checking for known variability
------------------------------

Running

.. code-block:: python

    tess_data_interface.print_variables_near_tess_target(tic_id=59661876)

will print any known stellar variability source near the TIC target. This information is based on the
`General Catalogue of Variable Stars <http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/gcvs/>`_.

Checking for known planets
--------------------------

Checking for known planets requires a separate data interface. Running

.. code-block:: python

    from ramjet.data_interface.tess_toi_data_interface import TessToiDataInterface
    tess_toi_data_interface = TessToiDataInterface()
    tess_toi_data_interface.print_exofop_planet_dispositions_for_tic_target(tic_id=425997655)

will print any known `Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program <https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/>`_ planet
dispositions for the passed TIC ID.
