Fisher forecasting for cosmological surveys

pyfisher is a python package for calculating Fisher matrices and for forecasting parameter uncertainties for cosmological surveys.

ðŸŸ¥  **Version 2 is a total revamp, so if you're used to what this software looked like before November 2020, you should switch to the ``legacy`` branch.** 

While the new version does not (yet) provide an interface for CMB lensing noise curves with iterative
delensing like the old one did, it has a simplified API, lots of pre-calculated
Fishers, and a tool to reparametrize into a Ïƒ8  parameterization.


* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://pyfisher.readthedocs.io.


Installation
------------

Install in two steps:

1. Git clone the repository
2. ``cd`` into the repository and run ``pip install -e . --user``.

The latter step just copies symbolic links to the relevant modules into a directory (managed by pip) that is in your python path.

Once this is done, you should be able to do things like

.. code-block:: python

				import pyfisher


from anywhere on your system.


Basic Usage
-----------

See and run ``python tests/test_lensing.py`` to reproduce Planck constraints and get a feel for how to use this package.
