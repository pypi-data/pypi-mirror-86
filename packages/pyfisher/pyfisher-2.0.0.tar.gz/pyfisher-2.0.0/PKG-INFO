        Fisher forecasting for cosmological surveys
        
        pyfisher is a python package for calculating Fisher matrices and for forecasting parameter uncertainties for cosmological surveys.
        
        ðŸŸ¥  **Version 2 is a total revamp, so if you're used to what this software looked like before November 2020, you should switch to the ``legacy`` branch.** 
        
        While the new version does not (yet) provide an interface for CMB lensing noise curves with iterative
        delensing like the old one did, it has a simplified API, lots of pre-calculated
        Fishers, and a tool to reparametrize into a Ïƒ8  parameterization.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install in two steps:
        
        1. Git clone the repository
        2. ``cd`` into the repository and run ``pip install -e . --user``.
        
        The latter step just copies symbolic links to the relevant modules into a directory (managed by pip) that is in your python path.
        
        Once this is done, you should be able to do things like
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        				import pyfisher
        
        
        from anywhere on your system.
        
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        See and run ``python tests/test_lensing.py`` to reproduce Planck constraints and get a feel for how to use this package.
