PyMoDAQ, Modular Data Acquisition with Python, is a set of **python** modules used to interface any kind of experiments.
It simplifies the interaction with detector and actuator hardware to go straight to the data acquisition of interest.

It has two purposes:

* First, to provide a complete interface to perform automated measurements or logging data without having to write a user/interface for each
  new experiment, this is under the *Dashboard_module* environment and its two extensions.
* Second, to provide various tools (modules) to easily build *custom apps*

It is divided in three main modules:

* **Dashboard_module** : This is the module that will initialize actuators and detectors given the need of your
  particular experiment. You configure the dashboard using an interface for quick launch of various configurations.
* **DAQ_Logger_module** : This module lets you log data from one or many detectors defined in the dashboard. You can log data
  in a binary hierarchical hdf5 file or towards a sql database
* **DAQ_Scan_module** : This module lets you configure automated data acquisition from one or many detectors defined
  in the dashboard as a function or one or more actuators defined also in the dashboard.

The detectors and the actuators are represented and manipulated using two control modules:

* **DAQ_Move_module** : used to control/drive an actuator (stand alone and/or automated). Any number of these modules can be instantiated.
* **DAQ_Viewer_module** : used to control/drive a detector (stand alone and/or automated). Any number of these modules can be instantiated.

and many others to simplify any application development.
