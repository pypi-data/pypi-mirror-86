## v0.5.7 - 20 Nov 20

We are finally introducing a Docker installation for Remo! We are also releasing some changes that make Remo more flexible and a paid Team version.

**Features**

- Installation via Docker is now supported. Among other things, this allows to have a PostgreSQL server running remotely for increased reliability
- Releasing a new pip package for remo-python. Main improvement: search function inside a dataset now works
- Improved documentation across the board
- We have removed limitations to the IP address where you can serve Remo
- Paid Team version of Remo is now available

**Bug fixes**

- Deleting specific images at times failed. This is now fixed

## v0.5.4 - 24 Oct 20

Fixed a bug in the dataset page where scrolling with a filter applied did not display all the pictures correctly. Thanks to Richard for reporting it!

---

## v0.5.3 - 23 Oct 20

This release includes some minor optimization and a bug fix. Specifically:


* We optimized load time to count images in annotation export form
* Fixed a bug where we couldn't delete a dataset that had some broken images inside (this issue was affecting our demo too)


---

## v0.5.2 - 6 Oct 20

We are issuing a fix for the registration process we introduced in v0.5, and introducing the ability to export annotations based on filtering by image tag

**Features**

* Now you can export annotations for a selection on images based on filters by image tags

**Bug fixes**

* Fixed upload instance segmentation annotations in CSV format
* Fixed token validation

---

## v0.5.0 - 30 Sep 20

In this major release, we are introducing a breakdown by tags on annotation statistics, and our user registration module. We have also greatly reduced the size of the wheel, which is now about 14 MB (30% of its previous size).

**Features**

* For an annotation set, you can now break down statistics by image tags. Among other things, this allows to easily visualize the distribution of objects and images in train/test splits
* We have added a user registration module. You may now verify your email and register your free token to enjoy unrestricted access to remo.

**Optimizations**

* Reduced the size of distribution pip package from 50 MB to 14 MB

---

## v0.4.24 - 18 Sep 20

This release contains fixes to our notification system.

**Bug fixes**

* Cancel on the upload sessions persisted on the view after being closed.
* When starting an upload, there was a case when the upload statistics arent displayed and the page is cropped from the top.

---

## v0.4.23 - 16 Sep 20

In this release, we are adding persistance of active upload sessions and a shortcut to delete objects in the annotation tool (thanks to user Om for the feedback).

**Features**

* On annotation tool, you can now use the Delete or Backspace key to delete the selected annotation object, without a Delete confirmation form

**Optimizations**

* We are improving the notification system experience. Notifications are now persistent, so you will not lose any of active upload session details in case you close the tab or reload the page. And you will be able to watch status of all active uploads
* In case of failure to access our online demo, we have added a fail-safe view that allows you to access the demo with a button click

**Bug fixes**

* On dataset view, classes and tags from different annotation sets now have colours matching that of the corresponding annotation set
* Dropdown to select annotation sets was overflowing from the page

---

**Features**

* Dataset filters: filter by class, tag, image names and task
* Tags can now be exported as a separate csv file

**Bug fixes**

* Duplicating a dataset resulted in some naming conflicts
* Issues with uploading tags from the Python library

---

## v0.4.14 - 24 Jul 20

Another round of small incremental improvements:

* Based on user feedback, we are not allowing to have multiple datasets with the same name (if upgrading remo, existing dataset with duplicated name will be renamed)
* Some UI fixes: improvement to object pop up in annotation tool, better handling of long annotation set names inside a Dataset, more explicit loading behaviour when remo is loading a large set of annotations

---

## v0.4.13 - 20 Jul 20

---
## v0.4.1 - 29 May 20

**Main Changes**

Most of the work has been about introducing a notification system to inform on progress for images and annotation uploading and parsing, including a detailed breakdown of any error. Nothing fancy, but a great improvement to reliability of the app.

We also expanded the Command Line Interface, allowing for more options (such as kill remo, delete datasets), and simplified the connection between the sdk and the remo server.

For the rest, we completed a series of smaller UX-driven changes to improve usability (including showing selected annotation sizes) and fixed few reported bugs.

**Breakdown**

Bug fixes:

* Delete all images from dataset causes error
* Delete an image and re-upload it: should be allowed
* Up-to-date count of images after fast deleting
* Fix download latest available electron app

Changes:

* Notification system for data upload. You can now monitor the upload of data and get a breakdown of errors that occur.
* Expanded Command Line Interface suit of options
* SDK: rework the connection with remo app and introduce clear option to connect to a remote remo server. "import remo" in conda now does not launch the server
* Annotation tool, delete object: ask for confirmation
* Image view and Annotation tool - objects height and width information

---
## v0.3.42 - 19 May 20

Quick fix to handle directories with space within their name

---

## v0.3.41 - 8 May 20

**Main Changes**

Switched to PostgresSQL for database management, instead of SQLlite. This makes the whole app more responsive and reliable.
For the rest, we implemented a number of small fixes aimed at making making remo more robust

**Breakdown**

Bug fixes:

* Fixed annotation statistics inconsistencies for image classification
* Fixed sending feedback form
* Fixed autologin in browser, and in electron after user changes password
