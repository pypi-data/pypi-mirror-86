        #ffbot.save(df, week)
        #df, week = ffbot.load()
        
        # Optimize the assignment of players to positions each week to maximize remaining season discounted total points (points this week are worth more than points in future weeks)
        #  decides which players to add and drop
        #  optimization is repeated for current roster, for one player add/drop, two player add/drops, etc.
        >>> ffbot.optimize(df, week, team, positions)
        
        # Output will look like:

        #
        #  which means that optimal weekly rosters of your current players scores 1583.94 points
        #  across the season and 367.51 discounted points (points in week 1 are worth more than week 12).
        #  The best free agent to add is Kansas City, which increases discounted points by 2.24 (although lowers total season points by 16.27 and lowers value over replacement by 7.98).
        #  Two other free agent pickups improve discounted points.
        #  Only one Waiver claim (for Jordon Howard) increases discounted points.
