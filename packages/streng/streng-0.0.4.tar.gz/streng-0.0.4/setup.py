# LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
# Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and closely integrated with `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ data structures.
# Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:
# - A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables
# - Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics
# - Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data
# - Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables
# - Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets
# - High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations
# - Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes
# - Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data
# Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.
