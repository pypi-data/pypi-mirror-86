Description: # pyvesteltv
        
        _pyvesteltv_ is a Python 3 library for interacting with Vestel television sets. Inspiration to create this library became from home automation project to allow [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) integration. 
        
        Vestel is a Turkish television manufacturer. Their brands include for example Procaster, Medion and Finlux.
        
        **Note!** These television sets are quite cheap. This implicates "interesting" APIs and therefore some interactions with the TV might seem a bit "hackish" :)
        
        Library has been tested only using Procaster LE-50F449.
