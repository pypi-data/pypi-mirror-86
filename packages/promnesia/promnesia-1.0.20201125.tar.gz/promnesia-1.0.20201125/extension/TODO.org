* Testing scenarios
** [#A] [2019-04-19 Fri 22:38] open new visited tab via a link (have a html page for that)

 Comment:
 shit. it doesn't trigger if I open new tab form the link, but seems to work fine if I create new tab and enter the url..
*** [2019-04-21 Sun 09:52] 
    onCreated with url set
    onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete

** refreshing the tab
    multiple onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete

** click url in the same tab
    onUpdated with url set   
    onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete
    (that works now)

** url changes automatically in the same tab (e.g. youtube)
    ------ tested on YT watch later
    onUpdated with url set
    NO onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete
 

** open new empty tab, type in url, enter
  first, when you open the tab:
    onCreated with empty tab
    onUpdated with url set   
    onUpdated with complete
  then when you type in the url:
    onUpdated with url set
    onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete


** tab open triggered via external link handling
    onCreated with url set
    onDomContentLoaded
    onUpdated with status complete
** [2019-04-21 Sun 10:16] ok, overall onUpdated(complete) seems the most reliable. the only a bit annoying thing is that it happens late sometimes
   I guess I could keep some sort of cache? not sure..
** TODO [2019-08-10 Sat 12:11] move them to end2end test
