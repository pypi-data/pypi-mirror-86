# autotyper

A simple command line tool to write the contents of a file to the cursor after a delay of few seconds. It uses
the `pyautogui` package to simulate the keystrokes to write out the file where the cursor is placed.


## Installation

Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. 

```
pip install autotyper
```

You will have the `autotyper` command available to go on your system.

## Usage

```
usage: autotyper [-h] -f FILE -d DELAY

Write file content on cursor

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -f FILE     input file containing the code
  -d DELAY    Delay in sec before writing to the cursor
```

```
$ autotyper -f bubblesort.c -d 10
Writing file content to cursor in 10 sec...
```

In this time, position your cursor to where you want to type out the text, when the delay ends, 
the content of the file will be written to the cursor. Can be used in online exams
to write the content of a file, where copy paste is not allowed in the text box.
