        ## About timecord
        
        time-cord is a library that:
        - Tracks time spent on Discord
        - Tracks time spent on specific servers & channels
        
        Currently only Mac OS is supported.
        
        #### Areas for improvement:
        - Support for non-Mac OS devices
        
        #### Dependencies:
        - Pillow
        - Easyocr
        - tendo
        - tzlocal
        
        With the rise of Discord as a platform for teams and friend groups alike, it's important to watch your time management on the platform. There are no current apps specifically for discord time management, so this library aims to fill that gap.
