class Connector:
    """
    Decorator class for mapping empty events to user implementing slots.

    This class helps mapping events to specific slots. 'Kiwoom' instance
    contains mapping information which had been set from two methods.

    1) Kiwoom.connect(event, signal, slot)
    2) Kiwoom.set_connect_hook(event, param)

    This decorator does not contain those mapping information but only
    uses the one defined in instance. This is because decorator should
    work on various contexts. The first parameter of wrapper function
    in __call__ method, i.e. api, is 'self' argument for Kiwoom object.

    This class has three main methods.
    1) Connector.__call__(event)
      - act as a decorator for pre-defined Kiwoom events
      - below is the usage example

        class Kiwoom(API):
            ...
            @Connector()
            def on_event_connect(self, err_code):
                pass
            ...

    2) Connector.mute(bool)  # static method
      - warning message can be turned on/off.

    3) Connector.connectable(fn)  # static method
      - Check if given fn is a bounded method to an instance.
      - If fn is not a bounded method, it should be static or lambda.
      - Bounded method is important to handle continuous information

    def __call__(self, ehandler):
        """
        Decorator method to call slot method when event connected to slot has been called.

        When event has been called, this decorator method is called with event method as arg.
        Then wrapper function wraps the event and then the function is returned to be called.

        Inside the wrapper, it takes all args from the event. The First arg is 'self' which is
        an instance of Kiwoom class. The rest of args depends on which event has been called.

        Firstly, execute event handler which is initially an empty method in the module. But
        this process is needed when an empty method is overridden. Then, find the right slot
        connected to the event. If found, execute it with the same args forwarded from event.
        If not, just print a warning message. This message can be turned on/off.

        Usage example
        >>  class Kiwoom(API):
        >>      ...
        >>      @Connector()  # decorator
        >>      def on_event_connect(self, err_code):
        >>          pass  # empty event
        >>      ...

                key = args[getfullargspec(ehandler).args.index(hook) - 1] if hook else None
