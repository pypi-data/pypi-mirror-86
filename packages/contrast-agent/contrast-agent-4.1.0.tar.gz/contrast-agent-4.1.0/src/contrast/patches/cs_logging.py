    Prevent recursive propagation when logging in assess

    We run the risk of recursively logging propagation events inside of log
    statements. This is because the logging module sometimes uses streams to
    output logs, and these logging events can inadvertently cause additional
    log output that we use for debugging within our assess code. We want to
    prevent this from occurring. Part of the reason for this is that we now
    instrument stream reads and writes, but we also are aware that StringIO
    is implemented with a lot of string building under the hood.

    The purpose of this patch is to make sure that we are in scope any time
    that log output is being produced.
