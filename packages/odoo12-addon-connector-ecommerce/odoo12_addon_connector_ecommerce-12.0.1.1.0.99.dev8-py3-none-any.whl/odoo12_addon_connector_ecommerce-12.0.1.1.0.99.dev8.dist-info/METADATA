Connector for E-Commerce
========================

This modules aims to be a common layer for the connectors dealing with
e-commerce.

It sits on top of the `connector`_ framework and is used by the
e-commerce connectors, like `magentoerpconnect`_ or
`prestashoperpconnect`_.

That's a technical module, which include amongst other things:

Events

  On which the connectors can subscribe listeners.
  The events it adds are:

   * ``on_invoice_paid(self, record)``
   * ``on_invoice_validated(self, record)``
   * ``on_invoice_validated(self, record)``
   * ``on_picking_out_done(self, record, method)`` where method is
     'partial' or 'complete'
   * ``on_tracking_number_added(self, record)``
   * ``on_product_price_changed(self, record)``

 Components

  A piece of code which allows to play all the ``onchanges`` required
  when we create a sales order.

  Another one which allows to add special lines in imported sales orders
  such as Shipping fees, Cash on Delivery or Discounts.
