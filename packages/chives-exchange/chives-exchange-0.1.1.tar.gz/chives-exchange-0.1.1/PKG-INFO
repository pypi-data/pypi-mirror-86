Description: # chives-exchange
        Implementation of a stock exchange with matching engine and a web UI powered by 
        Flask.
        
        ## Getting started
        The webserver communicates to the matching engine through RabbitMQ, which can be 
        most easily run using docker:
        ```bash
        docker run -d --rm \
            --name "rabbitmq" \
            -p 5672:5672 \
            -p 15672:15672 \
            rabbitmq:3-management
        ```
        
        Both the webserver and the matching engine reads from and writes to a SQL 
        database, which by default is a SQLite located in `/tmp/chives.sqlite`. To 
        initialize the database schema:
        ```bash
        python -m chives initdb
        ```
        
        Run the webserver and matching engine in two separate processes. Make sure that 
        the matching engine is not erroring out because of failure to connect to 
        RabbitMQ.
        ```bash
        python -m chives start_engine
        python -m chives webserver
        ```
        
        You can now follow the demo [here](https://xuganyu96.github.io/chives-exchange/) 
        to try it out.
