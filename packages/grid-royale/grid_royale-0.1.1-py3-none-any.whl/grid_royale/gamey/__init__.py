Gamey is a cute reinforcement learning framework.

I wrote Gamey so I would have a clear separation between generic reinforcement learning architecture
and the specific game of GridRoyale. Gamey defineds states, observations, actions, strategies,
cultures. It defines these as base classes that should be overridden.

See the `sample_games/blackjack.py` module for an example of using Gamey on Blackjack.
