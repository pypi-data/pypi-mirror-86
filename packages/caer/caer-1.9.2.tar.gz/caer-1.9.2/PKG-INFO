Description: # Caer -  Modern Computer Vision on the Fly
        
        A Computer Vision library in Python with powerful image and video processing operations.
        Caer is a set of utility functions designed to help speed up your Computer Vision workflow. Functions inside `caer` will help reduce the number of calculation calls your code makes, ultimately making it neat, concise and readable.

        ## Install
        See the Caer **[Installation][install]** guide for detailed installation instructions including building from source.
        
        Currently, `caer` supports releases of Python 3.6 onwards; Python 2 is not supported (nor recommended). 
        To install the current release:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install caer
        ```
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Example
        ```python
        >> import caer
        
        # Load a standard 640x427 test image that ships out-of-the-box with caer
        >> sunrise = caer.data.sunrise(rgb=True)
        
        # Resize the image to 500x500 while MAINTAINING aspect ratio
        >> resized = caer.resize(sunrise, target_size=(500,500), keep_aspect_ratio=True)
        ```
        
        For more examples, see the [Caer demos](demos).
