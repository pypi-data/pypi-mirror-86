# Caer -  Modern Computer Vision on the Fly

A Computer Vision library in Python with powerful image and video processing operations.
Caer is a set of utility functions designed to help speed up your Computer Vision workflow. Functions inside `caer` will help reduce the number of calculation calls your code makes, ultimately making it neat, concise and readable.

## Install
See the Caer **[Installation][install]** guide for detailed installation instructions including building from source.

Currently, `caer` supports releases of Python 3.6 onwards; Python 2 is not supported (nor recommended). 
To install the current release:

```shell
$ pip install caer
```


## Getting Started

### Example
```python
>> import caer

# Load a standard 640x427 test image that ships out-of-the-box with caer
>> sunrise = caer.data.sunrise(rgb=True)

# Resize the image to 500x500 while MAINTAINING aspect ratio
>> resized = caer.resize(sunrise, target_size=(500,500), keep_aspect_ratio=True)
```

For more examples, see the [Caer demos](demos).
