A simple example::

  root.txt
  subdir/
  subdir/file.txt
  subdir/logs/

.. -> expected_listing

Respecting indentation
----------------------

The text captured is determined by the indentation of the capture directive.

::

    First level of indentation.

        Second level of indentation.

            Third level of indentation.

        .. -> foo

Nested directives
-----------------

If two capture directives are nested, the outer one is effective.

::

    First level of indentation.

        Second level of indentation.

            Third level of indentation.

        .. -> foo

    .. -> bar

That holds true even if more dashes are included::

    example

.. --> another
