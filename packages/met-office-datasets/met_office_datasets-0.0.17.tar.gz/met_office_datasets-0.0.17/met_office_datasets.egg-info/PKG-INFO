        <!-- So tips building conda stuff. I said it took ages to build the env and didn't wat to keep doing that for testing the build. Answers:

        you can point the shell to your workdir and run the conda_build.sh from that folder
        and you can source build_env.sh to get into the buidl env, then conda deactivate to get into the host env and install / modify packages in there
        the workdir is shown in the error message after conda build failed
        otherwise you might want to try conda mambabuild ... which is included in boa to see if that could help speed up your build env provisioning
        
        
        Otherwise, you might want to try to use conda debug instead of conda build in the first place. This only creates the environment setup but doesn't start the build.
