# KEGGutils:
Working with **KEGG** in **Python** and **NetworkX**
# <img src="/img/logo_cut.png" alt="Drawing" width = "630"></img>



**KEGGutils** is a toolkit designed for working with the *Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome* database in *Python* with a quick and easy to use interface: in a single line you can download data from KEGG's REST API, organize in a graph-like format provided by *NetworkX* and immediately start exploring.

*KEGGutils* is much more than just an API interface: other than a series of tools to better interface yourself with the service, it provides expanded *NetworkX* classes and methods ( totally nx-compatible ) to handle different types of data and help you better exploit underlying structures. 
KEGGutils is easily expandable and can be immediately integrated anywhere you use *NetworkX* to process data.

## Current build status:

*master branch* : [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filippocastelli/KEGGutils.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/filippocastelli/KEGGutils)

## Installing KEGGutils
# <a href="https://pypi.org/"><img alt = PyPi src="https://pypi.org/static/images/logo-large.72ad8bf1.svg" height="100"></img></a>

You can just clone this repo and use it's content as any other python package, but if you just need a super easy drop-in solution *KEGGutils* is available as a *PyPi* package:

to install it you just need to run

`pip install KEGGutils`
 
 and that should be it!
 
## Dependencies
To make sure KEGGutils works as it should, a few dependencies must be satisfied:
- networkx
- matplotlib
- awesome-slugify
- requests
- Pillow
- scipy

note: if you use pip to install KEGGutils, it should automatically get the needed dependencies for you!

note: you can create an environment with all the required dependencies using the incldued anaconda environment configurator, you just need to run

`conda env create -f keggutils_env.yml` 

to create a `keggutils_env` anaconda environment with all the required dependencies.

## Getting started

In this repo can find four dense yet easy to follow tutorials covering most of *KEGGutils*'s functionalities and more are coming in the next future.
