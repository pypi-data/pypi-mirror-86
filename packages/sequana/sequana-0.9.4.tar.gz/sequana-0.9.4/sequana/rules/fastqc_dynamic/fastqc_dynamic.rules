    This rule is a **dynamic** rule (see developers guide). It can be included
    in a pipeline with different names. For instance in the quality_control
    pipeline, it is used as fastqc_samples and fastqc_phix. Here below,

    Required parameters
        - __fastqc_%(name)s__wkdir: the working directory
