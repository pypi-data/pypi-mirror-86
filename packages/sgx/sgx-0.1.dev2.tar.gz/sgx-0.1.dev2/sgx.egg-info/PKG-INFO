Description: The *Selfish Gene Algorithm* is a population-less evolutionary optimizer loosely inspired by the dashing interpretation of the Darwinian theory popularized in the scientific blockbuster [*The Selfish Gene*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene). It enables a user to efficiently find the list parameters, either discrete symbols or real numbers, that maximizes a given target function
        
        Since 1998, the *Selfish Gene* was [exploited](https://goo.gl/Baw9I8) by different researchers, and a few brand new approaches derived from it. For celebrating (almost) a quarter century mark, it has been  rewritten from scratch in Python 3, with improved usability and tons of new features.
