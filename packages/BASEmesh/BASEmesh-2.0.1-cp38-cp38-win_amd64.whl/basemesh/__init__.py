"""Pre-processing and mesh generation toolkit for BASEMENT.

This package contains utilities for generating and processing 1D and 2D
mesh geometries for use with the numerical simulation software such as
BASEMENT (https://basement.ethz.ch/).

It features standalone mesh generation utilities leveraging Jonathan
Shewchunk's Triangle (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), as
well as mesh editing and interpolation utilities.

BASEmesh can also be installed as a plugin for QGIS
(https://qgis.org/en/site/), allowing usage of its functionality via
the plugin interface.

For additional information, refer to the BASEMENT website linked above
or visit the project repository at
https://git.ee.ethz.ch/basemesh/basemesh-v2/.
