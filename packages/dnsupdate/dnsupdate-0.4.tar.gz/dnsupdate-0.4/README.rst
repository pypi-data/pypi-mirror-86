**dnsupdate** is a dynamic DNS client that has first-class support for IPv6 and
aims to be easily configurable to meet the needs of any situation. Unlike most
other dynamic DNS clients, **dnsupdate** has been designed from the
start to support IPv6 and many different update services. It is written in
Python and configured using YAML, making it easy to use and extend.

Features
--------

* Built-in support for FreeDNS_, nsupdate.info_, as well as any service that
  uses the standard `DynDNS protocol`_
* IPv6 support
* Simple YAML configuration file
* Obtain addresses from a web service, router or local interface
* Only submits an update if the address has changed
* Respects API return values to avoid abuse bans

``dnsupdate.py``.

It is also `available on the Arch Linux
AUR <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dnsupdate/>`_.

Configuration
-------------

**dnsupdate** is configured using a single `YAML file`_.
The path to the file can be specified on the command line. If not,
**dnsupdate** will try to use ``~/.config/dnsupdate.conf`` and
``/etc/dnsupdate.conf``, in that order.

.. _YAML file: http://yaml.org/

Most users will likely be satisfied with a simple configuration like
this:

::

    dns_services:
        - type: NSUpdate
          args:
              hostname: example.nsupdate.info
              secret_key: 26Yg7wUhxo
