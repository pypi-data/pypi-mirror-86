"""
The TSL2591 sensor - High Dynamic Range Digital Light Sensor
============================================================

See https://www.adafruit.com/product/439

Gain & Timing
You can adjust the gain settings and integration time of the sensor to make it more or less sensitive to light, depending on the
environment where the sensor is being used.

Gain:
GAIN_LOW: Sets the gain to 1x (bright light)
GAIN_MEDIUM or GAIN_MED: Sets the gain to 25x (general purpose)
GAIN_HIGH: Sets the gain to 428x (low light)
GAIN_MAX: Sets the gain to 9876x (extremely low light)

The integration time can be set between 100 and 600ms, and the longer the integration time the more light the sensor is able to integrate,
making it more sensitive in low light the longer the integration time. The following values can be used:
100MS
200MS
300MS
400MS
500MS
600MS
