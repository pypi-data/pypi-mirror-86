    Fibonacci Implementaion

    The Febonacci numbers are the numbers in the following sequence
    0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,............

    In Mathematical terms,the sequence Fn of the fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-1)

    with seed values
    F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1

    Example : 
    Fibonacci(5) = 5
    Fibonacci(10) = 55
    Fibonacci(1) = 1
    Fibonacci(2) = 2
    Fibonacci(12) = 144

    Tower Of Hanoi Implementation Using Recursion

    Tower of hanoi is a mathematical puzzle.It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any poles.

    The puzzle starts with a disk in a neat stack u ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top making it a conical shape.

    The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole (Source Pole) to another pole (Destination pole) with the help of the third pole (auxiliary pole)

    The puzzle has two rules :
    1 . You Can't place a larger disk onto smaller disk or vice-versa
    2 . Only one disk can be moved at a time

    Moves Reqd to Solve This puzzle is given by : 2^(n)-1

    Example :
    Number Of Dics : 3
    Source Pole : A
    Destination Pole : C
    Auxiliary Pole : D

    Solution :
    Tower_of_hanoi(3,"A","B","C")
    Move Disk From Source  A To Destination B
    Move Disk From Source  A To Destination C
    Move Disk From Source  B To Destination C
    Move Disk From Source  A To Destination B
    Move Disk From Source  C To Destination A
    Move Disk From Source  C To Destination B
    Move Disk From Source  A To Destination B
