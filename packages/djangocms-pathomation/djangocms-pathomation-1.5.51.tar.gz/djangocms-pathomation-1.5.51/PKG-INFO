        HOW TO INSTALL
        ---------
        
        > **Django CMS not installed yet?** Take a look at the official documentation: (https://docs.django-cms.org/en/release-3.4.x/introduction/install.html)
        
        
        1. Install our package
        
            `pip install djangocms-pathomation`
            
        
        2. Get the plugin code (this will create a folder "plugin" in the location where you are currently located with your terminal)
        
            `pip install --no-deps djangocms-pathomation -t plugin`
        
        3. Go to your current location folder and open the folder "plugin". Inside, copy the folder "pathomation" into directory of your django-cms project where *settings.py* is also located.
        
        
        4. Open *settings.py* (*located inside the folder with the name of your website/project*) with an editor and add "pathomation" to INSTALLED_APPS
        
            `INSTALLED_APPS = ['pathomation',]`
        
        5. Navigate `cd` with your terminal into your django-cms project where *manage.py* is located and run the following command:
        
            `Python manage.py makemigrations`
        
        6. Finally, run the following command:
        
           `Python manage.py migrate`
           
        7. Done! You can start the server again with the following command:
        	`Python manage.py runserver`
        	
        	
        
        QUICK START
        ---------
        
        1. Inside Django CMS, navigate to the admin page by adding `/admin` to the end of your site's URL
        
        	`www.example.com/admin/`
        
        2. Inside the Django administration, navigate to Pathomation -> Settings ->  *+add* -> My Pathomation connection settings and fill in your credentials and save.
        
        2. To make sure your credentials are correct: Test the connection, by clicking on the *Test connection* button.
