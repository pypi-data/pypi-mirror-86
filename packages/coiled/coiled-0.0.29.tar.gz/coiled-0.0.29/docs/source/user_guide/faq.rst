.. dropdown:: How do I access my data?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    You can access many different file formats using Dask and related libraries.

    -   `Tabular data <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dataframe-create.html>`_
    -   `Array data <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-creation.html>`_
    -   `Text data <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/bag-creation.html>`_

    Large datasets should live on the cloud in services like S3 to avoid data
    transmission costs.

    Additionally, if you have small data locally you can use other Dask APIs, like
    Dask-ML or Dask Futures to do heavy computation on small datasets comfortably.


.. dropdown:: How do I install libraries into my Coiled clusters?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Coiled helps you manage software environments both on your local machine
    and on cloud resources.  You can specify custom environments with conda or pip
    environments files with the ``coiled.create_software_environment`` function and
    Coiled will manage building Docker images for you that can then be used in Dask
    clusters or other jobs on the cloud.

    See :doc:`software_environment` for more information.


.. dropdown:: Do I have to migrate my data to Coiled?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    No.  Coiled manages computation.  Coiled helps you get data from data stores, process it,
    and write out to those same data stores.


.. dropdown:: Can I use Coiled to read private data on AWS?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Yes.  If you create a Coiled cluster from a location that has AWS credentials
    then Coiled will generate a secure token from those credentials and forward it
    to your Dask workers.  Your Dask workers will have the same rights and
    permissions that you have by default.

    Alternatively, for additional control we can also deploy Coiled within your AWS
    account, and allow you to specify and manage IAM roles directly.

    See :doc:`security` for more information.


.. dropdown:: Is my computation and data secure?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Coiled provides end-to-end network security with both AWS networking policies
    and with TLS encryption.  Coiled does not persist or store any of your data,
    except in memory as you are doing computations.

    See :doc:`security` for more information.


.. dropdown:: How much does Coiled cost?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Coiled is currently in beta. During this time **Coiled is free for all beta users**.

    You will not be charged for any of the compute resources you use, however there is a limit of
    100 concurrently running cores per user. This policy will change in the future when Coiled is opened
    up to a broader audience, but until then we are happy to provide beta users cloud computing
    resources at no cost. Thank you for trying out Coiled!


.. dropdown:: How do I invite my colleagues / students / ...?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    We're glad that you're having a good time and want to invite colleagues or
    students.  Send a quick e-mail to hello@coiled.io with e-mail addresses and a
    team name and we'll set you up as an administrator over your new team.

    See :doc:`teams` for more information.


.. dropdown:: Why do I get Version Mismatch warnings?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    When running cloud computations from your local machine we need to ensure some
    level of consistency between your local and remote environments.  For example
    your Python versions should match, and if you want to use a library like
    PyTorch or Pandas remotely we should probably also install it locally.  When
    Dask notices a mismatch, it will tell you with a warning.

    Matching versions can be challenging if handled manually.  Fortunately Coiled
    provides services to help build and maintain software environments that match
    across local and remote environments.

    See the :doc:`software_environment` documentation for more information.


.. dropdown:: Can I use Coiled to do machine learning / data science / ... ?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Yes!  Coiled builds on the popular PyData ecosystem of tools, and Dask in
    particular.  To learn more about what you can do with Dask and Python see the
    following links:

    -   `Dask <https://dask.org>`_
    -   `Dask Examples <https://examples.dask.org>`_

    You may also want to check out our `Youtube channel
    <https://youtube.com/c/Coiled>`_ for interviews with community members using
    Python at scale.


.. dropdown:: Can I use Coiled from Sagemaker/VS Code/PyCharm/...?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Yes, you can use Coiled from anywhere that you can use Python.
    Coiled is agnostic to user environment.


.. dropdown:: Does Coiled support GPUs?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Yes, but access to launch GPUs is off by default for new users.

    If you have an active use case here and want to be added to the GPU access
    list, send us a note at hello@coiled.io.


.. dropdown:: Does Coiled support Jupyter notebooks?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Yes, see the Notebooks tab in the application for example notebooks.

    Coiled can run and manage arbitrary Python processes in the cloud,
    including Jupyter notebooks.  Note that today Coiled does not persist user
    state across notebook sessions.


.. dropdown:: Does Coiled support other clouds?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    Today Coiled supports AWS.  Due to demand we are now also fast-tracking Azure support.
    If support for other cloud technologies is important to you we encourage
    you to send a quick note to hello@coiled.io to let us know.


.. dropdown:: Can I run Coiled on-prem?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    If by on-prem you mean "in your own AWS account" then yes, please contact
    sales@coiled.io.

    If by on-prem you mean "on your own machines in your own data center" then yes,
    please contact sales@coiled.io.


.. dropdown:: Why do I need a local software environment?
    :container: mb-2
    :title: bg-white text-black text-left h6
    :body: bg-white
    :animate: fade-in

    When performing distributed computation with Dask, you’ll create a :class:`distributed.Client`
    object which connects your local Python process (e.g. your laptop) to your remote Dask cluster
    (e.g. running on AWS). Dask ``Client`` s are the user-facing entry point for submitting tasks to
    a Dask cluster. When using a ``Client`` to submit tasks to your cluster, Dask will package up and send data,
    functions, and other Python objects needed for your computations *from* your local Python process
    where your ``Client`` is running *to* your remote Dask cluster in order for them to be executed.

    This means that if you want to run a function on your Dask cluster, for example NumPy’s :func:`numpy.mean`
    function, then you must have NumPy installed in your local Python process so Dask can send the ``numpy.mean``
    function from your local Dask ``Client`` to the workers in your Dask cluster. For this reason,
    it’s recommended to have the same libraries installed on both your local machine and on the remote
    workers in your cluster.

    See the :doc:`software_environment` section for more details on how to easily
    synchronize your local and remote software environments using Coiled.
