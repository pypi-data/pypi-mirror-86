👋 Welcome to Coiled's documentation!

What is Coiled?
---------------

`Coiled <https://coiled.io>`_ is a deployment-as-a-service library for scaling Python. It takes the devops out of
data science to enable data professionals to spend less time setting up networking, managing fleets of
Docker images, creating AWS IAM roles, etc. and more time on their real job.

Coiled at a glance
------------------

.. tabbed:: Create Dask clusters
   :selected:

   Coiled manages Dask clusters and everything you need to scale Python in
   the cloud robustly and easily. Learn more in the :doc:`Dask clusters docs <cluster>`.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Launch a cluster with Coiled
      import coiled

      cluster = coiled.Cluster(
          n_workers=5,
          worker_cpu=4,
          worker_memory="16 GiB",
      )

      # Connect Dask to your cluster
      from dask.distributed import Client

      client = Client(cluster)

.. tabbed:: Use custom software environments

   Coiled helps you manage software environments by building Docker images
   from `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ and `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_
   environment files for you. Learn more in the :doc:`software environment docs <software_environment>`.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Create a custom "ml-env" software environment
      # with the packages you want
      import coiled

      coiled.create_software_environment(
          name="ml-env",
          conda=["dask", "scikit-learn", "xgboost"],
      )

      # Create a Dask cluster which uses your "ml-env"
      # software environment
      cluster = coiled.Cluster(software="ml-env")
