LIFX Photons Messages Generator
===============================

This is the code that takes in the LIFX protocol definition and some adjustments
and outputs the code for the ``photons_messages`` module.

Photons is a framework for interacting with LIFX products and can be found at
https://github.com/delfick/photons-core

Changelog
---------

0.6.4 - 23 November 2020
    * Compatibility with python3.9

0.6.3 - 7 May 2020
    * Fixed 1 bit reserved fields

0.6.2 - 7 May 2020
    * Can now understand size_bits: 1 in the source yaml as meaning T.Bool

0.6.1 - 21 September 2019
    * Formatted code with black and converted tests to pytest
    * Upgraded to `delfick_project <https://delfick-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

0.6.0 - 21 September 2019
    * I changed the many option in photons, it is now "multiple" instead

0.5.4 - 1 September 2019
    * Emit fmt: off and fmt: on stanzas so black doesn't destroy the code

0.5.3 - 28 June 2019
    * Emit fields as lists instead of tuples to ensure it's a list when there's
      only one item in it.

0.5.2 - 23 Jan 2019
    * Started using ruamel.yaml instead of PyYaml to load configuration

0.5.1 - 12 Jan 2019
    * Make it possible to say an enum value allows unknown values

0.5 - 3 Jan 2019
    Initial release

Tests
-----

Create a virtualenv somewhere and run the following in that virtualenv from this
directory::

    $ pip install -e .
    $ pip install -e ".[tests]"
    $ ./test.sh

Generating messages
-------------------

Once you have this installed in your virtualenv you can run the
``generate_photons_messages`` script in your PATH.

This takes in the following options:

--src or the SRC environment variable
    The path to the yaml file containing the definition of all the messages

--adjustments or the ADJUSTMENTS environment variable
    The path to the adjustments.yml that contains all the customization

--output-folder or the OUTPUT_FOLDER environment variable
    The directory that is the root of the output

Auto customization
------------------

The generator will make the following changes for you without you having to
specify them in the adjustments.yml

Packet names
    Packet names in the source yaml are of the form <Namespace><PacketName>.
    The code will strip the <Namespace>. So for example DeviceSetLabel is turned
    into SetLabel under the DeviceMessages class.

    If the name is ``<Namespace>Get`` then it's turned into ``Get<Namespace>``.
    Similar transformation is done for ``<Namespace>Set``. A ``<Namespace>State``
    message is kept as is.

Field names
    All field names are snake_case after transformation. For example if the field
    was called AmazingField, it would appear as amazing_field.

Adjustments
-----------

The main point of this code is that ``photons_messages`` has some high level
concepts and changes to the source definition. The adjustments.yml looks like
this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

    # If fields end up with these names then the generator complains
    invalid_field_names: ["payload", "count", "index", "fields", "Meta"]

    # Where to start counting reserved fields from
    # So because we say 5 here, the first reserved field will be called reserved6
    # the next will be reserved7, etc
    num_reserved_fields_in_frame: 5

    # The packets are split up by namespace, this list will say the order of the
    # namespaces in the list. All other namespaces not in the list will be added
    # at the end in whatever order they've been defined
    namespace_order: ["core", "discovery", "device", "light"]
    
    # We can use this to rename an entire namespace
    # So here we're saying the namespace `some_namespace` should actually be
    # called `other_namespace`. This new name is used in output options and the
    # namespace_order option above
    rename_namespaces:
      some_namespace: other_namespace
    
    # We can choose to ignore structs from being output
    # Here we're saying don't output either StructOne or StructTwo in fields.py
    # and replace StructOne with a `T.Bytes(size_bytes * 8)` where the size_bytes
    # comes from the field that is using this struct
    # And fields using StructTwo with the fields that are in StructTwo. Note that
    # StructOne doesn't need to actually be in the source yaml, but StructTwo does.
    ignore:
      StructOne: {}
      StructTwo:
        expanded: true
    
    # Output options define where we put our output
    # This is a list of options. You must specify printing enums, fields and all
    # the packets
    #
    # Each item in the list has the following options:
    #
    # create
    #   either "enums", "fields" or "packets"
    #
    # dest
    #   either a string that is the name of the file under output_directory
    #   or a list of strings specifying the path. So saying ``["messages", "lan.py"]``
    #     would produce a file at ``<output_folder>/messages/lan.py``
    #
    # static
    #   A string that is put at the top of that file
    #
    # options
    #   If create is packet then this is a dictionary of ``include`` and ``exclude``
    #   These are either a string or a list of strings of globs to be applied to
    #   the namespaces. Include is applied first and then exclude is applied.
    #   To include all namespaces, say ``include: "*"``
    output:
      - create: enums
        dest: "enums.py"
        static: |
          from enum import Enum

    # Types let's us specify special types that can then be used multiple times
    # by packets and structs. This let's us specify transformations in one place
    # rather than many.
    # They are of the form ``{<name>: <options>}`` and can be used by specifying
    # ``special_type: <name>`` in the options for a field (see "changes" below)
    # Note that we specify the type here so that you can only override a field
    # with the same type as this special type
    # So here we're defining a type called duration_type, it will appear in
    # fields.py like this:
    #   
    #  duration_type = T.Uint32.default(0).transform(
    #        lambda _, value: int(1000 * float(value))
    #      , lambda value: float(value) / 1000

    # Clones let us create a clone of a struct that has different options for use
    # elsewhere. For example the clone here is the LightHsbk struct but where all

    # The options for each field include ``more_extras`` and ``remove_default``
    # where more_extras adds more options to the type and remove_default makes it

    # the "changes" section.
