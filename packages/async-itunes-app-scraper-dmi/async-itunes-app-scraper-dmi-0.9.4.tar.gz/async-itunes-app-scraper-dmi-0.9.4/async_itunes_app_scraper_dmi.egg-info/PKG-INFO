Description: # iTunes App Store Scraper
        This defines a lightweight Python class that can be used to scrape app 
        information from the iTunes App Store. It defines a couple of methods that can
        be used to get relevant app IDs given a set of parameters, and a couple of 
        methods to then scrape data about these app IDs.
        
        Much of this has been adapted from 
        [app-store-scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/app-store-scraper), a 
        nodeJS-based scraper that does similar things. But this scraper uses Python.
        
        ## Getting started
        The following scrapes app details about all apps similar to the first result 
        for the 'fortnite' search query:
        
        ```python
        from itunes_app_scraper.scraper import AppStoreScraper
        import asyncio
        import pprint
        
        async def main():
            scraper = AppStoreScraper()
            results = await scraper.get_app_ids_for_query("fortnite")
            # similar = await scraper.get_similar_app_ids_for_app(results[0])
            
            async for app in scraper.get_multiple_app_details(results):
                pprint.pprint(app)
        
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
        ```
        
        Documentation is not available separately yet, but the code is relatively
        simple and you can look in the `scraper.py` file to see what methods are 
        available and what their parameters are.
