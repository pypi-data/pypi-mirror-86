Description: # Simple UNSC Sanctions checker with a GUI and fuzzy matching.
        
        Simple GUI for checking names against the UNSC Sanctions List and generating
        reports.
        
        Uses fuzzy matching score for hits. For single name matches, we recommend using
        90 Score.
        
        Loads sanctions list in xml format. You can supply your own list or download it
        from the UNSC website from within the program.
        
        Comes with a list, but you should probably download the newest version the first
        time you run the program.
        
        Also included wkhtmltopdf.exe, downloaded from wkhtmltopdf.org, used by pdfkit
        for generating pdf reports. You can download it again and overwrite it if you
        don't feel confortable using the supplied one.
