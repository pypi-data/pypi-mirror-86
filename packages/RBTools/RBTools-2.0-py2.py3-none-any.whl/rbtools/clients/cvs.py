                A list of revisions as specified by the user. Items in the list
                do not necessarily represent a single revision, since the user
                can use SCM-native syntaxes such as ``r1..r2`` or ``r1:r2``.
                SCMTool-specific overrides of this method are expected to deal
                with such syntaxes.

        Raises:
            rbtools.clients.errors.InvalidRevisionSpecError:
                The given revisions could not be parsed.

            rbtools.clients.errors.TooManyRevisionsError:
                The specified revisions list contained too many revisions.

        Returns:
            dict:
            A dictionary with the following keys:

            ``base`` (:py:class:`unicode`):
                A revision to use as the base of the resulting diff.

            ``tip`` (:py:class:`unicode`):
                A revision to use as the tip of the resulting diff.

            These will be used to generate the diffs to upload to Review Board
            (or print). The diff for review will include the changes in (base,
            tip].

            If a single revision is passed in, this will raise an exception,
            because CVS doesn't have a repository-wide concept of "revision",
            so selecting an individual "revision" doesn't make sense.

            With two revisions, this will treat those revisions as tags and do
            a diff between those tags.

            If zero revisions are passed in, this will return revisions
            relevant for the "current change". The exact definition of what
            "current" means is specific to each SCMTool backend, and documented
            in the implementation classes.

            The CVS SCMClient never fills in the 'parent_base' key. Users who
            are using other patch-stack tools who want to use parent diffs with
            CVS will have to generate their diffs by hand.

            Because :command:`cvs diff` uses multiple arguments to define
            multiple tags, there's no single-argument/multiple-revision syntax
            available.
