This file is the README of the library pypos3d.

1) INTRODUCTION:
================
This library is a port of the old DATA3D library of the OpenSource Pojamas project.
I own both of them.

pypos3d aims to replace Pojamas.DATA3D library with a very close interface.
Application ePOSER (in Eclipse RCP) is replaced by a new MMI concept based on 
LibreOffice/Python.

This Python library intends to give high level operations for some 3D files:
- WaveFront Files (.OBJ and compressed .obz [gziped]): 
  * Read / Write
  * Groups manupilation : add, remove, optimization, fusion
  * High level method:
    Plane Split, Plane Slice, Remesh, Hole filling

  All Wavefront functions (classes) are in the pypos3d.wftk package

- Poser Files (.PZ3, .CR2, .PZZ, .CRZ, .PP2, .PPZ):
  * Read / Write
  * Actors, Props, Cameras, ... manipulations: add, remove, rename
  * Morph report and morph report on alternate geometries
  * Cleaning
  
  All Poser functions (classes) are in the pypos3d.pftk packages

Initialy, Pojamas project was a Eclipse RCP application based on a SWT/Java3D MMI. 
For maintenance reason, this RCP application will be discontinued and shall be replaced
by another one (cf. chapter 4 'GUI').

2) INSTALLATION:
================

2.1 Library Installation:
-------------------------
The library shall be installed with pip:
> python3 -m pip pypos3d

2.2 GUI Install:
----------------
  1. On _Linux_ (and probably Mac - To Be Confirmed):
     Install first the library and its dependencies
     Launch the GUI installer : PyPos3D-App-Installer.ods
     Clic on **Check** install first and then on **Install**
     Close LibreOffice

     The installation is finished, you can use the PyPos3DLO.ods sheet

  2. On _Windows_ (and for pure LibreOffice Installation on Linux)
     You will need to extend the internal Python installation with the dependencies.
     Install the LibreOffice extension developed by Mauricio Baeza 
     https://gitlab.com/mauriciobaeza/zaz-pip
    
     Using ZazPip : Install numpy, scipy and xlrd

     Launch the GUI installer : PyPos3D-App-Installer.ods
     Clic on **Check** install first and then on **Install**
     Close LibreOffice

     The installation is finished, you can use the PyPos3DLO.ods sheet

3) DESIGN:
==========
The pypos3d Library has the following structure:
  * langutil : A personal generic package for some utilities
  * pypos3d.wftk : WaveFront manipulation package
    The main classes are pypos3d.wftk.WaveGeom and pypos3d.wftk.GeomGroup.
    Refer to WaveGeom documention for information

  * pypos3d.pftk : Poser files manipulation package

  * Dependencies :
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - xlrd

4) TESTS:
=========
This library is tested with unitest with a target coverage rate over 80%.
Unit tests are delivered in another package
Installation and commissionning tests are performed on:
- CentOS 8, 7
- Fedora >30
- Microsoft Windows 10 

5) GUI:
=======
As mentioned previously, the former Pojamas application was an Eclipse RCP (obsolete RCP3).
In the future, a WxPython application is forseen.
For tests purpose, a LibreOffice calc based GUI is proposed.
Refer to: Pojamas for download
The GUI requires LibreOffice >= 6.4 on Windows and LibreOffice >= 6.3 on Linux (CentOS > 7)

LICENCE:
This library is delivered under the BSD license.
