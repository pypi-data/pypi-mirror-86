Using xrtQook for script generation
-----------------------------------

- Start xrtQook: type ``python xrtQookStart.pyw`` from xrt/gui or, if you have
  installed xrt by running setup.py, type ``xrtQookStart.pyw`` from any
  location.

  .. note::
     The scaling of GUI may behave differently in different systems and Qt
     versions. If it looks wrong, try the scaling options in
     ``xrtQookStart.pyw``.

  .. note::
     If you want to start xrtQook from Spyder, select the run option
     "Execute in an external system terminal".

- Rename beamLine to myTestBeamline by double clicking on it (you do not have
  to, only for demonstration).

- Right-click on myTestBeamline and Add Source → BendingMagnet. The same can be
  done from the icon buttons on the left.

- In its properties change eMin to 10000-10 and eMax to 10000+10. The middle of
  this range will be used to automatically align crystals (one crystal in this
  example) unless the parameter myTestBeamline.alignE sets another value. Blue
  color indicates non-default values. These will be included into the generated
  script. All the default-valued parameters do not propagate into the script.

- Create a crystalline material CrystalSi. This will create a Si111 crystal at
  room temperature.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor03.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Add a generic OE -> OE. This will add an optical element with a flat surface.

  .. note::
     The sequence of the inserted optical elements does matter! This sequence
     determines the order of beam propagation.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor04.png
     :scale: 60 %

- In its properties select the created crystal as 'material', put [0, 20000, 0]
  as 'center' (i.e. 20 m from source) and "auto" (with or without quotes) as
  'pitch'.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor05.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Add a screen to the beamline.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor06.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Give it [0, 21000, auto] as 'center'. Its height -- the last coordinate --
  will be automatically calculated from the previous elements.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor07.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Check the beamline layout with xrtGlow.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor08.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Add a plot and select the local screen beam.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor09.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Define an offset to the color (energy) axis.

  .. imagezoom:: _images/qookTutor10.png
     :scale: 60 %

- Save the beamline layout as xml.

- Generate python script (the button with a code page and the python logo),
  save the script and run it.

- In the console output you can read the actual pitch (Bragg angle) for the
  crystal and the screen position.
