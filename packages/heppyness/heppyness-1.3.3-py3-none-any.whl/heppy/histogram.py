        r'''
        Call a function on the nominal areas as well as all varied areas (in :code:`corr_variations` and :code:`uncorr_variations`),
        modifying the existing histogram.

        It is possible to convert the histogram to a different type (e.g. :py:class:`histogram2d` :math:`\to` :py:class:`histogram1d`)
        by giving new binedges of the desired new dimensionality. If the new binedges have a dimension other than 1D or 2D,
        the type will become :py:class:`basehistogram`.

        For a version of this method that leaves the original histogram unchanged and returns a copy with the function applied (and
        optionally new bin edges), see :py:func:`basehistogram.apply`. I HIGHLY recommend using that if the new histogram will be of
        different type to avoid confusion!

        Caution: if you change the binning, it is your responsibility that uncertainties encoded in the variations are handled correctly.

        :param function: function taking a :code:`numpy.array` as argument
        :type function: :code:`function`
        :param new_binedges: optional argument to set new binedges. If the binedges change the dimension of the histogram (e.g. from 2D to 1D), the histograms' type is changed accordingly
        :type function: :code:`function`

        Example 1: taking the sine of the areas

        .. code-block:: python

            import heppy as hp
            import numpy as np
            foo = hp.histogram1d(np.array([0., 1., 2., 3.]), [5., 6., 7])
            foo.apply_inplace(np.sin)

        Example 2: projecting a 2D histogram to its x-axis (integrating over the y-axis)

        .. code-block:: python

            import heppy as hp
            import numpy as np
