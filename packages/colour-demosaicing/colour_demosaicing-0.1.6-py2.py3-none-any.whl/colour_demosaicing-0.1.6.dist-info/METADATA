Features
--------

The following CFA (Colour Filter Array) demosaicing algorithms are implemented:

-   Bilinear
-   Malvar (2004)
-   DDFAPD - Menon (2007)

Installation
------------

Because of their size, the resources dependencies needed to run the various
examples and unit tests are not provided within the Pypi package. They are
separately available as
`Git Submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`__
when cloning the
`repository <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-demosaicing>`__.

Primary Dependencies
