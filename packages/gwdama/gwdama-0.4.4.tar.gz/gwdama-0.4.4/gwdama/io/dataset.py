def resample(self, outfs, fs=None, method='poly', return_type='dataset', dts_key=None, **reskwgs):
    """
    Resample ``self`` along the given axis using various possible methods, specified by the ``method`` argument. Each of them has some advantages and disadvantages, so a careful choise is advisable.
    
    ``poly`` (default) is based on `scipy.signal.resample_poly <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample_poly.html#scipy.signal.resample_poly>`_ does upsampling/downsampling and the associated filtering, using a `polyphase filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphase_quadrature_filter>`_. This has a very good balance in speed and performance, with only a moderate distortion of the data close to the Nyquist frequency. If ``outfs`` and ``fs`` are prime, this can be quite slow too.
    
    ``fft`` is based on `scipy.signal.resample method <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.resample.html>`_. It does upsampling/downsampling and the associated filtering, entirely in the frequency domain, using the `Fast Fourier Transform technique <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation#Relation_with_the_discrete_Fourier_transform>`_ (bonus for data length that are multiple of two). Because it is using the Fourier Transform, a key assumption is that the signal that is fed in its input is *periodic*. This gives usually the best performances and mantaines the spectrum unaltered. However it can be slow if the input data lenght is not multiple of two and prime, and also if it is not multiple of the output samples. In the latter case, a slight distorsion of the time axis is also possible, with a linearly increasing phase difference. Avoid this method if this is the case.
    
    ``decimate`` is arguably the simplest and fastest method (``ftype='iir'``), although it is not always advisable to use it and the overal performances are not as good as the previous two methods. It is based on the `scipy.signal.decimate method <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.decimate.html>`_, which consists in an antilaiasing low-pass filter (either an ``'iir'`` or a ``'fir'`` filter) followed by a decimation, such as ``data[::q_factor]``. If a ``'iir'`` filter is chosen and the relative *q_factor* between input and output frequency is larger than 10, the decimate method is called recursively. For ``iir``, the distorsion can be significant in proximity of the Nyquist frequency. Selecting ``'fir'`` as ``ftype`` we will have a linear phase, the output will be the same of ``poly``, but the method will result generally slower. If we select ``'iir'``, it is going to be much faster, but the phase is only approximately linear. Also, differently from the other two methods, this is not suitable for *upsampling* or when the original sampling frequency is not a multiple of ``outfs``. In this case ``poly`` is used instead.
   
    Parameters
    ----------
    outfs : int
        Desired output frequency of the resampled data. It is advisable to pick a frequency that is submultiple of the original sampling frequency of the data
    fs : int, optional
        Sampling frequency of ``self``. If not provided, this is automatically recovered from ``self.attrs['sample_rate']``. If this attribute is not present an ``AttributeError`` is raised.
    return_trype : str, optional
        array, dataset, inplace
    method : str, optional
        Method with which to perform the resampling. Default is ``'poly'``, for a *poly-phase filtering*. Don't modify it if you don't have read the description above first
    return_type : str, optional
        This parameter determines the output of this method, and can take the values ``'dataset'`` or ``'array'``; a ``ValueError`` is rised if it doesn't match any of the latter. If this is set to ``'dataset'`` (default), a new :ref:`Dataset` object is created next to the current one, with the ``'_r{outfs}'`` string attached to its name, containing the data corresponding to resampled time series. If ``return_type`` is set to ``'array'``, the output is an array  
    dts_key : str, optional
        If ``return_type=='dataset'`` , this is the *key* associated to this dataset. If not set, custom name is chosen, which is the name of the current dataset followed by ``f'_r{outfs}''``. Notice that attempting to call this method twice without specifying the name will rase: ``RuntimeError: Unable to create link (name already exists)``

    taper_edges : bool, optional
        The edges of the whitened time-series can be round off to reduce filtering effects,. Dafoult True
    dts_key : str, optional
        If ``return_type=='dataset'`` , this is the *key* associated to this dataset. If not set, custom name is chosen, which is the name of the current dataset followed by ``_whiten``. Notice that attempting to call this method twice without specifying the name will rase: ``RuntimeError: Unable to create link (name already exists)``
    
    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        When this method is called twice with ``return_type=='dataset'`` and different ``dts_key`` parameters are not specified
