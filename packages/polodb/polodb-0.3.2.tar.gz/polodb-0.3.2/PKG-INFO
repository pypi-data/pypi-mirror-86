        # Features
        
        - Simple/Lightweight/Easy to learn and use
        - Various languages binding
        - Embedded(No standalone processes, no cross-process calls)
        - No runtime dependency
        - NoSQL
        - MongoDB-like API
        - Cross-Platform
        - Store data in ONE file
        
        # Introduction
        
        PoloDB is a library written in Rust
        that implements a lightweight [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
        
        PoloDB has no dependency(except for libc),
        so it can be easily run on most platform(thanks 
        for Rust Language).
        
        The data of PoloDB is stored in a file.
        The file format is stable, cross-platform, and
        backwards compaitible.
        
        The API of PoloDB is very similar to MongoDB.
        It's very easy to learn and use.
        
        # Platform
        
        Theoretically, PoloDB supports all platforms that Rust compiler
        supports.
        But PoloDB is a personal project currently.
        Limited by my time, I only compile and test on the following platform:
        
        - macOS 10.15 x64
        - Linux x64 (Tested on Fedora 30)
        - Windows 10 x64

        - [Rust](./docs/en-US/Rust/READEME.md)
        - [Node.js](./docs/en-US/Node.js/READEME.md)
        - [Python](WIP)
        
        # Developing Plan
        
        The feature will be implemented one by on in order.
