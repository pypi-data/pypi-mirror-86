Description: MPF Language Server
        ===================
        
        Language server for MPF config.
        
        Installation (from pypi)
        ------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install mpf-language-server
        
        Usage in IDE
        ------------
        
        IntelliJ Based IDE
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For any IntelliJ based IDE (such as PyCharm, WebStorm or PhpStorm) you need to
        install a LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin.
        Then add ``mpfls`` as ``Raw command`` for ``yaml`` files in
        "Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> Language Server Protocol -> Server Definitions".
        
        VSCode
        ~~~~~~
        
        For vsCode install the extension in `vscode-client <vscode-client>`_.
        
        Emacs
        ~~~~~
        
        Integration with Emacs is accomplished using `lsp-mode <https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode>`_.
        
        A minimal completion setup can be achieved with the :code:`lsp-mode`, :code:`yaml-mode`, :code:`company`, and :code:`lsp-company` packages.  Company is a general purpose completion package for Emacs.  :code:`lsp-company` is a helper package for using Company with :code`lsp-mode`.
        
        1. Install :code:`lsp-mode`, :code:`company`, :code:`yaml-mode`, and :code:`lsp-company` by running :code:`M-x package-install` and following the instructions.
        2. Add the following to your Emacs init file: ::
        
             ;; Register the mpfls server
             (require 'lsp-mode)
             (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook #'lsp)
             (defvar lsp-language-id-configuration
               '((yaml-mode . "mpfls")))
        
             (lsp-register-client
               (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "mpfls")
                 :major-modes '(yaml-mode)
                 :server-id 'mpfls))
             (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
        
             ;; Configure company-lsp
             (require 'company-lsp)
             (push 'company-lsp company-backends)
