Transient gravitational wave parameter conversions
==================================================

Sometimes it is useful to sample in some parameters and return others in the output.
E.g., sampling in chirp mass and mass ratio can be much more efficient than sampling in component masses.

We have many functions to do this.

These are used in multiple places:
- `PriorDict`s have a `conversion_function`, for the GW PriorDicts, these are from this module.
- `WaveformGenerator`s can use a `parameter_conversion`, again these are from this module.
- A `conversion_function` can be passed to `run_sampler`, this is done as a post-processing step.
For CBCs either `generate_all_bbh_parameters` or `generate_all_bns_parameters` can be used.
