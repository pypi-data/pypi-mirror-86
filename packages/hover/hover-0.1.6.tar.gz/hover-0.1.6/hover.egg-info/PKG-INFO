        -   :ferris_wheel: **UPCOMING** throw a model in the loop and exploit all kinds of active learning [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/phurwicz/hover-binder/master?urlpath=/proxy/5006/app-active-learning) [Source](https://github.com/phurwicz/hover-binder/app-active-learning/main.py)
        -   :whale: **UPCOMING** cross-check with Snorkel-based distant supervision [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/phurwicz/hover-binder/master?urlpath=/proxy/5006/app-snorkel-explorer) [Source](https://github.com/phurwicz/hover-binder/app-snorkel-explorer/main.py)
