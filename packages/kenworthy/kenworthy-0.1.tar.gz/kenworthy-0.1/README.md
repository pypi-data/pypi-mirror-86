`kenworthy` provides tools to solve Kepler's equation for binary orbits, and to model dust rings and clouds orbiting around substellar companions.

The module `kepler3` provides a fast and simple set of routines to estimate Hill sphere sizes, orbital periods and velocities at periastron and apastron, which enable characterisation of complex (i.e. not a simple exoplanet transit) eclipses.

`exorings3` models giant ring-like structures transiting stellar disks, and provides fast calculation of light curves for forward modeling. Drawing routines for making figures of exoring systems in matplotlib are optimised with `Artist` primitives.
