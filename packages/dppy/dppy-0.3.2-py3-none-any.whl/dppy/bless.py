    Given data X, a similarity function, and its related similarity matrix similarity_function(X, X),
    an (eps, lambda)-accurate dictionary approximates all principal components of the similarity matrix
    with a singular value larger than lambda, up to a (1+eps) multiplicative error.

    The algorithm is introduced and analyzed in :cite:`RuCaCaRo18`, for a more formal
    definition of (eps, lambda)-accuracy and other potential uses see :cite:`CaLaVa17`.

    :param array_like X_data: input data, as an ndarray-like (n x m) object

        eval_L(X_1, X_2) = K(X_1, X_2)

    :param float lam_final: final lambda (i.e. as in (eps, lambda)-accuracy) desired.
        Roughly, the final dictionary will approximate all principal components with a singular value
        larger than lam_final, and therefore smaller lam_final creates larger, more accurate dictionaries.

    :param float rls_oversample_param: Oversampling parameter used during BLESS's step of random RLS sampling.
        The rls_oversample >= 1 parameter is used to increase the sampling probabilities and sample size by a
        rls_oversample factor. This linearly increases the size of the output dictionary, making the algorithm
        less memory and time efficient, but reduces variance and the negative effects of randomness on the accuracy
        of the algorithm. Empirically, a small factor rls_oversample = [2,10] seems to work.
        It is suggested to start with a small number and increase if the algorithm fails to terminate or is inaccurate.

    :param random_state: Random number generator (RNG) used for the algorithm.
        By default, if random_state is not provided or is None, a numpy's RandomState with default seeding is used.
