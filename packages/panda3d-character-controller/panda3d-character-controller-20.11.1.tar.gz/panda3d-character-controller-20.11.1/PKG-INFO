        ## Install
        Install the character controller via pip

        pip install panda3d-character-controller
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        Using the character controller itself is quite easy, simply instantiate it and
        call the startPlayer function. You can set it's start position and rotation
        using the setStartPos and setStartHpr functions.
        
        ```python3
        base.cTrav = CollisionTraverser("base collision traverser")
        base.cTrav.setRespectPrevTransform(True)
        
        # actual character setup
        player = PlayerController(base.cTrav, "path/to/config.json")
        # start the player
        player.startPlayer()
        ```
        
        ### Config
        Configuration of the player is done in a json file that has to be passed to the
        controllers constructor.
        Simply copy and tweak the config file which can be found in the data folder.
        For further information see the PDF documentation.
        
        ### PDF Documentation
        An extensive documentation about the character controller can be found in the
