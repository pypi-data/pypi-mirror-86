Description: # pycycling
        
        A Python package for interacting with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) compatible bike trainers and power meters. 
        
        The package uses [Bleak (Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient)](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)
        behind the scenes to connect and communicate with bike trainers. 
        Bleak is cross-platform with support for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 
        Therefore this module should also work on these operating systems. 
        Please refer to the Bleak repository for more information about supported platforms.
        
        ## Disclaimer
        __I take no responsibility if the use of this package breaks your turbo trainer or stationary bike. 
        Use at your own risk! 
        It has only been tested with a Tacx NEO 2T trainer, and Garmin Vector 3 power meter pedals.__
