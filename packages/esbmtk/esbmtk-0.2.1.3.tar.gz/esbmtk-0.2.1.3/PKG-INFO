        # ESBMTK - An Earth-sciences box modeling toolkit
        
        ESBMTK is python library which aims to simplify typical box modeling
        projects the in Earth-Sciences. I started this project to teach myself
        python and explore object oriented programming. The code became
        however functional enough that the focus of this project has shifted
        to make box modeling more approachable for classroom teaching. So
        performance and scalability are not great. Specifically, the solver is
        just a simple forward Euler scheme, so stiff problems are not handled
        gracefully.
        
        At present, it will calculate masses/concentrations in reservoirs and
        fluxes including isotope ratios. It provides a variety of classes
        which allow the creation and manipulation of input signals, and the
        generation of graphical results. There is however no support for
        chemical reactions (including equilibrium reactions).

        # News
        
        -   Nov. 23<sup>rd</sup> A model can now save it's state, which can then be used
            to initialize a subsequent model run. This is particularly useful
            for models which require a spin up phase to reach equilibrium
        
        -   Nov. 18<sup>th</sup>, started to add unit tests for selected modules. Added
            unit conversions to external data sets. External data can now be
            directly associated with a reservoir.
        
        -   Nov. 5<sup>th</sup>, released version 0.2. This version is now unit aware. So
            rather than having a separate keyword for `unit`, quantities are
            now specified together wit their unit, e.g., `rate = "15
               mol/s"`. This breaks the API, and requires that existing scripts
            are modified. I thus also removed much of the existing
            documentation until I have time to update it.
        
        -   Oct. 27<sup>th</sup>, added documentation on how to integrate user written
            process classes, added a class which allows for concentration
            dependent flux. Updated the documentation, added examples
        
        -   Oct. 25<sup>th</sup>, Initial release on github.

        # Contributing
        
        Don't be shy. Contributing is as easy as finding bugs by using the
        code, or maybe you want to add a new process code? If you have plenty
        of time to spare, ESMBTK could use a solver for stiff problems, or a
        graphical interface ;-) See the todo section for ideas.

        # Installation
        
        ESBMTK relies on the following python versions and libraries
        
        -   python > 3.6
        -   matplotlib
        -   numpy
        -   pandas
        -   typing
        -   nptyping
        -   pint
        
        If you work with conda, it is recommended to install the above via
        conda. If you work with pip, the installer should install these
        libraries automatically. ESBMTK itself can be installed with pip
        
        -   pip install esbmtk

        # Documentation
        
        The documentation is available in org format or in pdf format. 
        See the documentation folder, [specifically the quickstart guide](https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/master/Documentation/ESBMTK-Quick-Start_Guide.org).
        
        At present, I also provide the following example cases (as py-files
        and in jupyter notebook format)
        
        -   A trivial carbon cycle model which shows how to set up the model,
            and read an external csv file to force the model.

        # Todo
        
        -   expand the documentation
        -   provide more examples
        -   do more testing
