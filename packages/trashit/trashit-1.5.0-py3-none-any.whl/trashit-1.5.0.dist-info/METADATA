# Trash-it - V1.0

A Simple, command line utility to safely put the files/folders to the bin. 
(A Safer way than rm command. )

Have you ever deleted the wrong files by `rm` which were not backed up ? Have you felt that Panic ? That eagerness to bring back the files that have been lost ? 

If yes, or no, anyways, I have a tool, which can be verry usefull to you. (*can*)
