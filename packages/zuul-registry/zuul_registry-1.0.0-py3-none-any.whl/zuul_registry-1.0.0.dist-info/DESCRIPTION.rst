Zuul Registry
=============

This is a container image registry for use with the Zuul project
gating system.

The defining feature of this registry is support for shadowing images:
it allows you to upload a local version of an image to use instead of
an upstream version.  If you pull an image from this registry, it will
provide the local version if it exists, or the upstream if it does
not.

This makes it suitable for use in a Zuul-driven speculative image
pipeline.

The latest documentation for Zuul is published at:
https://zuul-ci.org/docs/

Getting Help

There are two Zuul-related mailing lists:

`zuul-announce <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-announce>`_
  A low-traffic announcement-only list to which every Zuul operator or
  power-user should subscribe.

`zuul-discuss <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-discuss>`_
  General discussion about Zuul, including questions about how to use
  it, and future development.
