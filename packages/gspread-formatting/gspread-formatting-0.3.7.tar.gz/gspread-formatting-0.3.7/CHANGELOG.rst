-------------------
- Bump to v0.3.5. [Robin Thomas]

v0.3.3 (2020-09-24)
-------------------
- Bump to version v0.3.3. [Robin Thomas]
- Fixes #24. [Robin Thomas]

  A certain set of functions that exist both in batch and standalone mode
  are dynamically bound as local names in the functions subpackage. That makes
  them undiscoverable by IDEs like PyCharm. Adding a straightforward import
  statement for these function names -- even though the names are re-bound
  immediately with wrapped standalone versions of the functions -- makes
  the function names visible to PyCharm.

  successful test suite. [Robin Thomas]
- Remove pypy3 travis target until pandas install problems can be fixed.
